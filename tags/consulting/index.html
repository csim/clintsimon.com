    <p>Data migration can sink your project. It lurks around the edges of your estimation model, hiding deep dark secrets that will only be uncovered at the very end of the project. Nothing could be worse. Discovering that you need to increase the migration schedule 5 fold at the 11th hour can not only derail your project but if it happens too often it might derail your career.</p>

<p>I have learned a few lesson on this topic:</p>

<p><strong>Re-estimate your migration scope of work when there are significant changes in the new application.</strong> At the beginning of the project, migration seems easy. A new system with like functionality should have a similar data model with a one-to-one mapping against the old data model.</p>

<p>Often times the new system will morph into something completely different, creating complex transforms for the data migration process. Not only is this extra work for the data migration but you have to <em>define</em> this extra work.</p>

<p>Ideally when changes creep into the new system build, the data migration estimates are updated and timelines are adjusted. Having a designated data migration subject matter expert helps to spot trouble on the horizon and alert the team to data migration impact.</p>

<p><strong>Run your migration on the real data.</strong> There is no substitute for real migration data. Often times, sample data is used for too long which engenders a false sense of confidence. When you finally use the real data, there are a boat load of issues that you could not have predicted.</p>

<p>Use the real customer data as soon as possible in the process. Look at the outcomes in the new application, run scenario testing early and often. You simply have no idea what issues you will bump into.</p>

<p><strong>Think about performance.</strong> No matter how elegant your code or how perfect you attribute mappings are, there will come a time when performance is paramount. If the migration takes 10 days to complete, most likely you have failed.</p>

<p>Have a focus on performance from the beginning of the development effort. Identify the total number of source records to be transformed. Then get some baseline throughput numbers from you migration process. This will tell you how long the migration execution will take. You can also use a known duration to calculate how many records per second you need to achieve.</p>

<p>Once you know the desired parameters, you can start to optimize your code. Optimizing performance is an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/NET-Performance-Testing-Optimization-Complete/dp/1906434409">art form</a>.</p>

<p>Multithread is a good way to improve performance but it comes with major pitfalls. The saying goes: You implemented multithreading to solve your problem, now you have two problems. If you understand thread safety and the basics of multithreaded software design, then multithreading is a good option, otherwise stay away from it.</p>

<p><strong>Think about the execution plan &amp; timings.</strong> What time window is available to perform the migration? How much down time can you afford? Put together a timeline that clearly delineates the time allotted for each phase of the migration.</p>

<p>Often times one way around performance and timing issues is to implement a &ldquo;delta&rdquo; load where only the changed data is migrated. First you run the full load, then the delta process moves only the data that has changed since the last migration pass. This breaks the migration process into smaller pieces and allows for those pieces to be spread across a longer period of time. When it&rsquo;s time to go live, you only need to run the delta process once more to bring the data into synchronization, then you can launch the new system.</p>

<p><strong>Understand the differences between legacy and new systems with regard to business use cases.</strong> Don&rsquo;t just think about data model differences, think about business process differences. The business context around data attributes is important when the situation dictates a complex transformation.</p>

<p><strong>Document all data gaps for the customer.</strong> Inevitably you will run into data that simple cannot be directly mapped, transformed or converted to the new system. It is of the utmost importance to document these gaps, triage these issues with the client and work toward some form of resolution.</p>

<p>There are general three things that the client may decide:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ignore the data attribute. It is not important in the new system. Keep a backup of the old database just in case.</li>
<li>Map the attribute to a different attribute in the new system. Things have been simplified or consolidated and the new system recognizes this attribute in a different way.</li>
<li>Force the new system to consume the old attribute. Make a change request to add the old attribute to the new system. This usually stems from a mistake where important data attributes have been lost in the new system.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Plan for surprises.</strong> Your source and destination are fixed, therefore scope is fixed. The causes more timeline risk, therefore you need to counter with rigor in estimation, planning, engineering and additional timeline contingency. There is no room to remove features or functionality from the migration process.</p>

<p>I have seen one scope reduction approach work, which is to propose the reduction of data volume by the process of archiving old data. This does not reduce the data mapping scope but reduces the timeline because migration execution time is reduced.</p>

    <p>IT projects are difficult, long and arduous. Requirements change, budgets are tight, and deadlines loom like a dark cloud. Sometimes it feels like you are moving mountains to ship the project. It can be quite a grind. For people like us that care about the quality and craft of our work, this can become quite the pressure cooker.</p>

<p>We are very much invested in the success of the project and the success of the business as a whole. To the point where we sacrifice personal/family time and relationships.</p>

<p>Generally the technology nuts and bolts do not present the biggest obstacle. Accumulating context is the real money pit. A lot of time is spent understanding the customer&rsquo;s business process and how technology can help to streamline that process.</p>

<p>The problem here is that when the project is over &hellip; poof you are gone. Onto the next, without anything but some addition XP (epic set?!?) to show for it.</p>

<p>When the next project starts you will need to build this business context all over again. Again, venturing into unknown territory to discover the next dragon to be eviscerated. What a grind. Just when you get things figured out, you move on.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things that I have found which help:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t get to high or too low. When things go bad on the current project, form a copping mechanism. For me, I like to work out at the gym. You might try reading, cleaning or hanging out with friends. Make sure it&rsquo;s something that takes you mind off of work.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t get too invested. This can be a tough one especially for younger people. Try to realize that you are playing the long game. It&rsquo;s a marathon not a sprint. By avoiding living and dying with current project, you will be able to adapt to the next project much more easily.</li>
<li>Specialize in an industry vertical. By specializing you can build reusable knowledge and context which can be transferred to the next project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="must-have:31c69a2a81f7ad881c9a2895581cad31">Must have</h2>

<p><em>Experience.</em> Nothing trumps experience. The more times you are &ldquo;at-bat&rdquo;, the more lessons you learn. Particularly experience at progressively higher of levels responsibility is desirable. Challenging yourself is ultimately the only way to grow and learn.</p>

<p><em>Technology aptitude.</em> I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean reciting minute technical details from memory. I mean <em>understanding</em> the underlying principles of technology. Abstraction, service oriented architecture, componentization, dependency injection, user experience design. Deep understand of these topics are what separates the great consultants from the rest.</p>

<p><em>Consulting IQ.</em> Soft skills are where we make our money. Reading a room, understanding the motivations involved, working toward a common goal while avoiding or minimizing conflicts. These are things that a consultant does every day. It is hard to judge this quality</p>

<p><em>Confidence.</em> Nothing sells a candidate like the combination of confidence <em>and skills</em>. When someone is comfortable in their own skin, everyone around them can also be at easy with any situation. Usually confidence comes from a solid history of delivery experience and the understanding that the candidate can overcome any impediments to success.</p>

<p><em>Inquisitive nature.</em> Every single person on this planet should be constantly asking questions and learning. If the candidate is not asking questions (and hopefully intelligent questions), how can I hope to send that person into an unknown client situation and expect good results?</p>

<p><em>Personality and likability.</em> Ultimately our clients are people and people form relationships with others and those relationships affect important decisions. Likability goes a long way toward forging relationships. Simple things, like mentioning a hobby or sharing a laugh about some common interest can add up to extremely valuable relationships over time. Some of this comes from simply liking what you do for a living, but I think mostly it comes from a positive outlook.</p>

<p><em>Honesty.</em> Look, I know that things go sideways on projects. In fact, I would venture to say that every single project has a &ldquo;sideways&rdquo; phase at some point in the process. An honest candidate will talk intelligently about these situations and recognize that we do a difficult job and sometimes things don&rsquo;t work out as expected.</p>

<h2 id="deal-breakers:31c69a2a81f7ad881c9a2895581cad31">Deal breakers</h2>

<p><em>Candidate is too nervous to talk.</em> It&rsquo;s sad to say but if a candidate is too nervous to speak in an interview, there is no way that he will be able to meet with a client in unfamiliar environment. I usually go out of my way to have some small talk at the start of the interview, just to set the tone and send a message that I am approachable and we are going to have a pleasant conversation.</p>

<p><em>I don&rsquo;t hear excitement.</em> It&rsquo;s a job interview. Tell me why you are excited about this job. What you want to accomplish in your career and how you feel about seizing this opportunity. At a bare minimum, win me over with enthusiasm. Sometimes I will take someone who is excited and will work really hard over someone who has more skill.</p>

    <p>Learning new technologies and techniques is a part of life for any software developer. Programming is a quest for knowledge and understanding which lasts your entire lifetime. No other profession has a more dynamic working environment. Tools change and evolve on a daily basis it seems.  Learning is incumbent on all developers. Darwin&rsquo;s law applies, adapt or perish.</p>

<p>Luckily most of us are used to this environment and thrive on the constantly changing landscape. I have found over my career that the pace of change has only increased, particularly in the past few years. The move to cloud computing is a big driver and the open source movement is creating a climate of rapid discovery and change. Thousands of new approaches to old problems are being forged this very moment.</p>

<p>Benefits can be reaped if you are efficient with your time and energy. Your value as an employee can be traced back to your technology aptitude and that aptitude is greatly affected by your knowledge of the technology spectrum which you apply to a project. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you need to have the deepest knowledge on a particular technology but instead you need a broad view of how technology fits together and how to choose the right pieces to solve a problem. Suggesting the pieces can be more important that understanding how each pieces works.</p>

<p>Generally I try to follow a few key rules which keep me in touch with new technology:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Find quality sources.</strong> Find the best possible sources which apply to the technology space where you work. Each source should have excellent content covering a set of topics that could potentially apply to your daily work.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Organize the channels.</strong> Create channels to monitor your sources, <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google reader</a> works well, <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> a bit noisy. You want these streams to have a high signal to noise ratio. Don&rsquo;t add pundits or 24-hour tech news into this mix. They are too noisy. Add sources that you know produce great topical content. For me, technology specific tech blogs work best.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Read your channels regularly.</strong> I try to read through my sources at least once per day. Some days there isn&rsquo;t much to learn but other days I have multiple &ldquo;holy cow&rdquo; moments. If this becomes a chore then you might want to look for a new line of work :)</p></li>

    <p>One of the best things that you can do as a developer is to be equal parts lazy and smart. This is an art that can be mastered to great effect. I don&rsquo;t mean that you should abandon your passion for programming or stop being focused and goal driven. I mean that you should avoid work that is not absolutely necessary. To do that you need to be both lazy and smart in equal parts.</p>

<p>There are pitfalls. Laziness without being smart leads to inaction. Being smart without laziness leads to constantly reinventing the wheel. Ultimately the value you deliver needs to increase as a result of being lazy and smart.</p>

<p>Laziness means that you don&rsquo;t want to do work that is unnecessary. You would rather copy and paste a known good solution rather than write it from scratch. You would rather ask a colleague for a quick answer than search for the same answer for hours. You would rather do a quick prototype rather than spending days in meetings arguing about how the application should look.</p>

<p>Being lazy means that you are constantly looking for <em>congruent efficiency</em>. You want to find a better way to get a goal accomplished with the same quality but less effort. You want to spend more time making great software with great user experiences, and less time doing mundane tasks. Mundane tasks are like the scourge of software development. Luckily new tools and techniques are eliminating mundane tasks but there are still area where you can make significant time savings.</p>

<p>Being smart is the most important part of the equation. If you are just lazy, then you really don&rsquo;t get anywhere quickly. But put lazy and smart together, and you get magic. That elusive balance where you are practically cheating. Things are so easy and yet so effective. Smart makes your laziness seem like genius.</p>

<p>Some Ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Eliminate unnecessary meetings.</strong> Keep meetings short and to the point. Focus meetings on working software with demos.</li>
<li><strong>Have a code library for common patterns.</strong> Copy/paste from the library when you come across a pattern that you have used before. Keep the library up to date with latest practices and new patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage co-workers.</strong> When you have a hard problem, you may be surprised to learn that your colleagues have solved this problem in the past. Ask early in the cycle to avoid duplicate work and potential mistakes based on a potentially flawed approach. Hold code reviews so that you can validate your solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Search the internet.</strong> Sounds silly but I&rsquo;ve seen people plug away at a problem without looking for a solution online first. Google is your friend.</li>

    <p>You have been working here for about 3 years. Life is good. You come in as late as you like and leave late because the work is challenging and rewarding. No one is watching over your shoulder, most days you sling code until your mind goes numb. At any moment a nerf gun war can break out in the office. When Halo 3 was released, all work stopped and there was an all-nighter in the game room. Company parties are amazing, the Christmas party was at a rock-n-roll museum last year and you have an annual company awards ceremony at a hot night club.</p>

<p>The company has been growing at a rapid rate.  The employee count has doubled in the past year and the year before that it almost tripled. There are about 20 new people joining the company each month. Extending this growth out over the next couple of years, you can&rsquo;t help but think that the company will be a huge player in the market. Can we go public? Won&rsquo;t we all be rich?</p>

<p>One fine day, you notice that there are a few new people who just aren&rsquo;t fitting in. They come from larger competitors. Their idea of productivity is waving their hands in meetings talking about &ldquo;enterprise scale&rdquo; and &ldquo;web 2.0&rdquo;. Some others are clearly sub-par coders, quality is suffering. What is going on? You brush it off and continue with your daily routine.</p>

<p>Over time, you realize that the company has made some bad bets. It turns out that those misfit new hires where actually making two times what they were delivering in value. Those Christmas parties and award ceremonies cost in the millions of dollars. Worse yet, the company is insolvent, living off debt and investments my a lone angel investor. Wow, look how far this place has fallen. Your morale fads, this is not fun anymore. What are you going to do? You love this place and you can&rsquo;t bare to start looking for another job when all you friends work here.</p>

<p>This is a story all to familiar to anyone who has been around the consulting industry for a number of years. All to quickly the company that you grew to love changes right underneath your feet. Who is to blame? How did this happen?</p>

<p>This is part of the journey and an opportunity to do some growing up. First and foremost, understand that your beloved company is a <em>business</em>. And businesses have to make money or they don&rsquo;t exist for very long. You may have become emotionally attach to the company and assumed that you would work here in perpetuity, having fun with your friends. Reality is that unless a service business is run at a profit sooner or later it bites the dust.</p>

<p>The interesting part is that morale has a large influence on the trajectory that a company takes. In the beginning morale acts as a buoy, lifting the company to new heights. Good morale is contagious, each new person that enters the company is quickly infected with enthusiasm as soon as they walk in the door. You recruit your friends, everyone is cheerful and bright. Clients see this and are drawn to your energy and zest for details. Bottom line is that everyone believes in the company and you are all working towards a higher goal: your collective professional happiness.</p>

<p>The opposite is true in the declining phase of a company. No one wants to put in the extra effort that was once automatic. Meetings are pure hell, distrust in management is normal, projects fail, pride is lost. Bad morale is even more contagious. People love to complain and focus on the negatives.</p>

<p>Looking back at my career, I can say that I have been through this cycle at least 3 times. During the first 2, I had no idea what was happening. The last one I understood and tried to divorce myself from the situation by taking a clinical approach. I&rsquo;ve learned that this is the cycle of life at small consulting companies. You cannot change it or expect different results with the same inputs.</p>

<p>In my daily work, I lead teams that build software. These are &ldquo;line of business&rdquo; or &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; software systems. I come into contact with a lot of developers, all with differing backgrounds, experience levels and personalities. I see the good and the bad. Pride generally stands out as the most accurate quality indicator of the individual developer.</p>

<p>Having pride in your work makes you want to improve. If you are mindful of the effects that your work has on others, that can only lead to a better career path. First, you need to be self-aware and able to see your work through the eyes of a co-worker. Then you need to have the foresight to adjust your behavior accordingly.</p>

<p>Ask your self these questions, they all show pride in your work:</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-communicate-more-effectively-with-the-team:4087a2688a1790cb7eaab2ddc8ef5304">How can I communicate more effectively with the team?</h3>

<p>Be clear and concise. Don&rsquo;t ramble. Stay on topic, avoid distractions. Drive the conversation forward. Don&rsquo;t speak if you have nothing to say. When you speak, add value. Listen. Yield to the experts. Challenge but don&rsquo;t create conflict. Keep everything on a business level. Take time understand context. Provide context.</p>

<p>Follow through on your commitments. Don&rsquo;t get in over your head. Mentor others. Give constructive feedback. Call out issues early. Be proactive. Always give 100%. Be consistent. Take ownership. Take responsibility for mistakes.</p>

<p>Use descriptive variable names (even on private / local members). Add comments to code that is not obviously understood. Use the built-in documentation conventions of your language. Name classes, properties and methods in a <em>logical and consistent</em> way.</p>

<p>All of this ultimately forms your reputation as a developer. All you have is your reputation. I have moved jobs a fews times in my career and I can tell you that having a network of people who are aware of your capabilities is the best possible resource when it&rsquo;s time for job hunting.</p>

    <p>Whether you know it or not, you are training everyone you interact with each day. When you answer that email at midnight or take that call at 8PM, you are sending a message. The message is that you work any time and you are willing to sacrifice your personal life for the job.</p>

<p>In typical over-achiever fashion, you are reacting to each request without regard for your personal well-being. After following this pattern for years, I have realized that I need to stop the vicious cycle.</p>

<div class="vinette"><img src=

"{{ site.url }}/images/vicious-cycle-Zzbbc.jpg" />you can't win</div>

<p>Here are a few things that I have learned:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Prioritize and focus</strong>. Understand the actions that are most beneficial to your career advancement. Many times I have found myself chasing the shiny object without understanding why.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Say no gracefully.</strong> When enough is enough, just politely say no. Set your boundaries. Be reasonable but firm, anyone worth their salt will respect your boundaries.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ignore when possible.</strong> There are times when saying nothing is the best thing to do. Add value where you can but don&rsquo;t drive down a path that you cannot sustain. Under promise and over deliver.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To be clear, I am not advocating begin lazy or apathetic. Quite the opposite, I am saying that with the right priorities you can focus doubly on what matter to achieve twice the effect.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I have seen many developers struggle with a growing dilemma, do I devote my time to platform development?</p>

<p>When I say &ldquo;platform development&rdquo; I mean building application on products such as <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">Microsoft SharePoint</a> and <a href="http://crm.dynamics.com/online/default.aspx?tabid=fits-your-business&amp;fbid=gnPbjZqF5wO">Microsoft CRM</a>. The IT world is rapidly moving toward standardizing on platforms such as these. They offer lower IT costs, standardized infrastructure and overall lower cost of ownership. It makes sense from a business perspective, but what do you do as a developer?</p>

<p>The problem here is that we have all been devoting all of our time to becoming better coders, designing systems and generally attacking every problem from the ground up. Not so in the platform world. You begin with a packaged software product, then extend it to meet a customers needs. These extensions can be simply point and click configurations, embedded code such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, or compiled code which changes behavior in the product.</p>

<p>In the new world of platforms, we are asked to live in a box. That box is called a platform. They bring limitations, boundaries and a sense that we can&rsquo;t use all the tools that we have worked so hard to learn and build over the years.</p>

<p>Most of my experience is with <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">Microsoft SharePoint</a> and <a href="http://crm.dynamics.com/online/default.aspx?tabid=fits-your-business&amp;fbid=gnPbjZqF5wO">Microsoft CRM</a> but the trend is industry-wide. IT shops have been burned by custom software and they want some predictability over time. I get it.</p>

<p>Customers generally expect the platform to host a wide range of applications and act as a clearing house for all future development activities. The problem comes in when requirements don&rsquo;t match up to the platforms capabilities. This can be a scale issue, or a mismatch of the smallest detail. These gaps are extremely painful for developers because the client is expecting the fully baked solution, but the platform doesn&rsquo;t entirely deliver. It&rsquo;s up to us to build that last 10% of the solution, which takes 50% of the effort. Blarg!</p>

<p>In other scenarios, the product (particularly <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">SharePoint</a>) is a really &ldquo;big hammer&rdquo; that solves lots of problems and you have no choice but to use the entire platform. For instance, say a client wants Content Management. Well, <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">SharePoint</a> certainly does that, but it also comes with collaboration, profiling, personalization, single sign-on, search, etc. Sometimes it can feel like you boiling the ocean for a cup of tea.</p>

<p>I have struggled to reconcile these issues and come to the conclusion that there are really two options for developers.</p>

<h3 id="first-option:5270f738531673956d3b5b927c5892fc">First Option</h3>

<p>Swallow your pride and start learning a platform. There are a ton of opportunities right now for platform work, that work is not going to end any time soon and you might as well take the plunge sooner than later. There will be some limitations but in return you will get some opportunities that were not possible before.</p>

<p>Usually enterprises have a portfolio of systems, and your project is just one of them. In the platform world you will need to integrate with other systems in a more reliable and sensible way. Sometimes this integration work is custom (cha-ching!) other times it is not. But the point is that the platform allows you to think at a higher level without being mired in minutia of coding all the components yourself. The upside is that you can use you brain cycles to think about solving bigger problems and delivering more value.</p>

<h3 id="second-option:5270f738531673956d3b5b927c5892fc">Second Option</h3>

<p>Punt. Find a product company you want to work for, or a start-up that seems interesting. If you are in consulting there is a majority chance that you will be moved in to a platform role. If that&rsquo;s not where you want to be, get out immediately.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen too many people struggle through the transition. Always battling to get the custom application development work on any project and generally hating life. Don&rsquo;t get swept away in the idealized vision that you can buck the trend. See this transition for what it is to you, either a way to move in a new direction or get out before you cause yourself a lot of heartache.</p>

    <p>Over the years I have come across software consulting companies in various states. It occurs to me that there must be a finite set of categories that defines the culture of a consultancy. Here&rsquo;s a few that I have recognized.</p>

<p><strong>The oak tree.</strong> This company is rock solid and has been that way for many years. After establishing itself initially, stable but modest growth has lead to a consistency over time. To be successful at this company, you must deeply agree with the culture and value system. This can be a great place to have a long tenure and create long term professional relationship. Rebels and change agents need not apply.</p>

<p><strong>The Butterfly.</strong> This company is always morphing into something new. Things that are important today may have less valuable in the future. Hot and cold streaks plague the company&rsquo;s history. Take a job here only if you think that the experience you will gain out weighs the risk of a left turn when you least expect it. Often very few people know when the left turn is coming.</p>

<p><strong>The junkyard dog.</strong> This company will do anything to keep busy and stay in business. Web site? Mobile? ASP.NET? LAMP? Yep they do that. Take a job here if you want to be a jack of all trades. These are usually good resume builders and companies where you can figure out what technologies you are most passionate about. The downside can be randomization and lack of direction, usually the technology leadership is not necessarily that deeply technical because it is very difficult to be deep in all technologies.</p>

<p><strong>The Corporation.</strong> They are Enterprise. They are monumental. They will put a complex plan into place and deliver solid results on time and on budget through deliberate and consistent execution. You&rsquo;ll excel here if you enjoy structure and thrive when things are planned out to microscopic detail. Here&rsquo;s to &ldquo;synergy&rdquo;!</p>

    <p>Estimating a project can be one of the hardest things you do as a technology consultant. Over the years I have done my share of estimation and one thing has become clear to me. Estimation accurately is almost impossible. With lots of experience and some hard knocks, you can accumulate the courage necessary to throw down an estimate. Here&rsquo;s a few tips that I think might help.</p>

<p>Ask a lot of questions. The first thing you need to do is ask a ton of questions. The only way to get to the bone of the implementation is to understand all the information currently available about the project. Ask the WWWWH (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) questions.</p>

<p>When you think you have exhausted all the questions in your head, take a walk and forget about the estimation exercise. When you come back you will have more questions, no doubt.</p>

<p>There may very well be details that haven&rsquo;t been discovered. As the estimator, it is your job to put down a valid estimate. This isn&rsquo;t the motivation of the sales person, your business lead or the client for that matter. Having a valid estimate creates a framework and a roadmap that the team will follow throughout the project. Without solid questions you are shooting in the dark.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Be detailed. It&rsquo;s impossible to estimate any complex project by taking a high level view and throwing out numbers. You need to break the project down into digestible pieces in order to make sensible estimates that can hold water. For a budgetary estimate, I like to have my work broken down to no larger then 8 hour chunks. Based on this rule it is difficult to miss something entirely or overestimate something by more than 8 hours :)</p>

<p>Most times, the deeper that you think about the work, the more you realize that there are intricacies that you may not have considered when thinking at a high level. You need to find the bottom of the rabbit hole.</p></li>

<li><p>Assume away risk. One of the most important tools you have as an estimator is the assumption. The assumption is beautiful. It is the way that you politely tell a client no. Assumptions are effectively boundaries that define the border of the project scope. You can say what you will do all day, but that doesn&rsquo;t tell anyone what you won&rsquo;t do. Basically there is no good way to make the language around you requirements strong enough to stop a nefarious client from take you for a ride. Assumptions allow you to draw a clear line where the requirement stops.</p></li>

<li><p>Understand your client. You need to understand the client&rsquo;s goals, motivation, risk and reward. This is the context that will make you successful in the estimate process and during the delivery phase. Is the client vague? Are they distracted? Are then detail oriented? Anything that will effect the delivery team should be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>To a varied degree this can give you a &ldquo;gut feel&rdquo; for how the project will be run and communicated. If there are red flags, then you need to call those out, make assumptions and eliminate the perceived risk.</p></li>

<li><p>Build an estimate capable of satisfaction. The idea here is to produce an estimate that will make a client happy. Things change over the course of a project - new requirements, shifting priorities, unknown hurdles. When these changes happen, it is important that your estimate is big enough that you can still make the client happy at the end of the day.</p></li>

<li><p>You are probably thinking, &ldquo;well, why don&rsquo;t I just make the estimate huge?&rdquo;. The trick is to make the estimate big enough to accommodate the unknown but also fit into a logical and economical budget number. If you strike this balance it will allow the project team to manage the project to a happy conclusion because your estimates were large enough to make the client happy. Too small an estimate and there is no room for management.</p></li>
</ol>
