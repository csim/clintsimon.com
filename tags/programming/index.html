    <p>Data migration can sink your project. It lurks around the edges of your estimation model, hiding deep dark secrets that will only be uncovered at the very end of the project. Nothing could be worse. Discovering that you need to increase the migration schedule 5 fold at the 11th hour can not only derail your project but if it happens too often it might derail your career.</p>

<p>I have learned a few lesson on this topic:</p>

<p><strong>Re-estimate your migration scope of work when there are significant changes in the new application.</strong> At the beginning of the project, migration seems easy. A new system with like functionality should have a similar data model with a one-to-one mapping against the old data model.</p>

<p>Often times the new system will morph into something completely different, creating complex transforms for the data migration process. Not only is this extra work for the data migration but you have to <em>define</em> this extra work.</p>

<p>Ideally when changes creep into the new system build, the data migration estimates are updated and timelines are adjusted. Having a designated data migration subject matter expert helps to spot trouble on the horizon and alert the team to data migration impact.</p>

<p><strong>Run your migration on the real data.</strong> There is no substitute for real migration data. Often times, sample data is used for too long which engenders a false sense of confidence. When you finally use the real data, there are a boat load of issues that you could not have predicted.</p>

<p>Use the real customer data as soon as possible in the process. Look at the outcomes in the new application, run scenario testing early and often. You simply have no idea what issues you will bump into.</p>

<p><strong>Think about performance.</strong> No matter how elegant your code or how perfect you attribute mappings are, there will come a time when performance is paramount. If the migration takes 10 days to complete, most likely you have failed.</p>

<p>Have a focus on performance from the beginning of the development effort. Identify the total number of source records to be transformed. Then get some baseline throughput numbers from you migration process. This will tell you how long the migration execution will take. You can also use a known duration to calculate how many records per second you need to achieve.</p>

<p>Once you know the desired parameters, you can start to optimize your code. Optimizing performance is an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/NET-Performance-Testing-Optimization-Complete/dp/1906434409">art form</a>.</p>

<p>Multithread is a good way to improve performance but it comes with major pitfalls. The saying goes: You implemented multithreading to solve your problem, now you have two problems. If you understand thread safety and the basics of multithreaded software design, then multithreading is a good option, otherwise stay away from it.</p>

<p><strong>Think about the execution plan &amp; timings.</strong> What time window is available to perform the migration? How much down time can you afford? Put together a timeline that clearly delineates the time allotted for each phase of the migration.</p>

<p>Often times one way around performance and timing issues is to implement a &ldquo;delta&rdquo; load where only the changed data is migrated. First you run the full load, then the delta process moves only the data that has changed since the last migration pass. This breaks the migration process into smaller pieces and allows for those pieces to be spread across a longer period of time. When it&rsquo;s time to go live, you only need to run the delta process once more to bring the data into synchronization, then you can launch the new system.</p>

<p><strong>Understand the differences between legacy and new systems with regard to business use cases.</strong> Don&rsquo;t just think about data model differences, think about business process differences. The business context around data attributes is important when the situation dictates a complex transformation.</p>

<p><strong>Document all data gaps for the customer.</strong> Inevitably you will run into data that simple cannot be directly mapped, transformed or converted to the new system. It is of the utmost importance to document these gaps, triage these issues with the client and work toward some form of resolution.</p>

<p>There are general three things that the client may decide:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ignore the data attribute. It is not important in the new system. Keep a backup of the old database just in case.</li>
<li>Map the attribute to a different attribute in the new system. Things have been simplified or consolidated and the new system recognizes this attribute in a different way.</li>
<li>Force the new system to consume the old attribute. Make a change request to add the old attribute to the new system. This usually stems from a mistake where important data attributes have been lost in the new system.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Plan for surprises.</strong> Your source and destination are fixed, therefore scope is fixed. The causes more timeline risk, therefore you need to counter with rigor in estimation, planning, engineering and additional timeline contingency. There is no room to remove features or functionality from the migration process.</p>

<p>I have seen one scope reduction approach work, which is to propose the reduction of data volume by the process of archiving old data. This does not reduce the data mapping scope but reduces the timeline because migration execution time is reduced.</p>

    <p>I have been doing work with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap 3</a> as of late. When building responsive layouts, I find it very handy to immediately see which predefined size group you are currently viewing. Here’s a little snippet that shows the current Bootstrap size modifier.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/30aed7384208a76f6a07.js"></script>

<p>This is especially helpful when viewing a page from a mobile device or table. You can easily deduce which size group maps to a particular device in each orientation.</p>

    <p>I have always had a sneaking suspicion that my keyboard repeat rate and repeat delay settings were a little too slow for my taste. Windows only lets to you increase the values in a fixed range but with a registry change, you can adjust as you please.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10286225.js"></script>

<p>Play around with AutoRepeatDelay and AutoRepeatRate, these are the settings that work for me.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t set the AutoRepeatDelay too fast, it will make it so that when you type letters they are repeated immediately. Makes it really hard to type your password :)</p>

    <p>Lately I have been learning about <a href="http://git-scm.org">Git</a> and <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. Most of this work is done at the command line, I have found myself quickly amassing PowerShell functions that acts as shortcuts.</p>

<p>One very handy shortcut is the ability to launch the <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">sublime text editor</a> and open the current directory as a project. Or alternately passing in a file to edit.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10286154.js"></script>

<p>Once this function is in your powershell profile, just type &ldquo;edit&rdquo; at the command prompt and sublime will open the current folder.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m not a long-term planner. I&rsquo;ve never made a &ldquo;5 year plan&rdquo; or thought about where I want to be 10 years from now. I simply look at what my options are and make a decision about what to do next.</p>

<p>I only learned to code because my dad needed a problem solved. He ran a consulting business where he needed to perform regular equipment maintenance. It was 1996 and the web was new. It seemed like it might be possible to track schedules and log maintenance activities via the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>I was young and foolish, so I started right away. I knew very little about programming having only built very simple programs in basic on my commodore 64 roughly 10 years earlier. I picked Perl because it was available with my college computer lab account which was the right price (free). I could also expose the script to the web, score!</p>

<p>Looking back, I was a pretty awful programmer at that time. I had about 5 tricks in my bag and writing a function was not one of them. The Perl script became one long if statement with print statements to emit HTML. Around 800 lines of code with no functions. Wow, does this seem backwards to me now. To top it off, I wrote a rudimentary serialization process to save my in-memory HashTable to a text file.</p>

<p>To be fair, I did not know the word &ldquo;serialization&rdquo; at the time. I just knew that I needed to save some data and have it available on the next web request. I happily wrote some code at the end of my script to store the text file after each request was rendered and some code at the top to read the file. Done.</p>

<p>I was absolutely intoxicated by the process of coding my first web application. I literally could not get enough. I worked on the script with every sliver of free time that I had and when I wasn&rsquo;t working on it, I was thinking about it or dreaming about it.</p>

<p>How could I get this element to render? How could I get the code to run faster? What do I do with this data? Can I build a calendar?</p>

<p>I was great. I probably learned more in those 6 weeks than at any other time in my career. But more than that, it forged my desire to be a programmer. I am still chasing the high that I felt over 15 years ago on the first project. There is nothing like having an idea, building it and watching it grow into something valuable.</p>

<p>That little application that I built went on to run a substantial part of my dad&rsquo;s business for a few years until I replaced it with a new version that was more professional. It was great to see it work for so long but the larger net effect was that I was hooked on coding. I haven&rsquo;t looked back once.</p>

    <p>Over the past year or so, my career has taken a turn toward what I would call &ldquo;pure consulting&rdquo; or put more plainly, &ldquo;giving people my opinion&rdquo;. During this time I really hadn&rsquo;t written any code to speak of, minus some small side projects. There just wasn&rsquo;t a need for it and frankly I had my hands full.</p>

<p>All that changed when I started a new project and took ownership of a large chunk of functionality. As the development lead I sure as hell wanted to get my hands dirty with the code, setup the framework, etc. So I jumped in head first and started coding.</p>

<p>I honestly forgot how cool it is to code something from scratch and see it grow from an idea to a fully functional application. It was total invigorating to see things take shape and evolve, each step of the way becoming more intricate and complex.</p>

<p>I never get tired of the code manipulation cycle. Making a code change, seeing the result and making another change, over and over again. It&rsquo;s just one of those things that never gets old. It really feels like a disease is some ways. Your mind is consumed, all your thoughts spent strategizing on the next set of changes and thinking of the long term implications.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a skill that feels intrinsic, not a learned behavior but something must have been inside you from the beginning. How lucky am I that I get paid to do this? Pretty cool.</p>

    <p>Learning new technologies and techniques is a part of life for any software developer. Programming is a quest for knowledge and understanding which lasts your entire lifetime. No other profession has a more dynamic working environment. Tools change and evolve on a daily basis it seems.  Learning is incumbent on all developers. Darwin&rsquo;s law applies, adapt or perish.</p>

<p>Luckily most of us are used to this environment and thrive on the constantly changing landscape. I have found over my career that the pace of change has only increased, particularly in the past few years. The move to cloud computing is a big driver and the open source movement is creating a climate of rapid discovery and change. Thousands of new approaches to old problems are being forged this very moment.</p>

<p>Benefits can be reaped if you are efficient with your time and energy. Your value as an employee can be traced back to your technology aptitude and that aptitude is greatly affected by your knowledge of the technology spectrum which you apply to a project. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you need to have the deepest knowledge on a particular technology but instead you need a broad view of how technology fits together and how to choose the right pieces to solve a problem. Suggesting the pieces can be more important that understanding how each pieces works.</p>

<p>Generally I try to follow a few key rules which keep me in touch with new technology:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Find quality sources.</strong> Find the best possible sources which apply to the technology space where you work. Each source should have excellent content covering a set of topics that could potentially apply to your daily work.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Organize the channels.</strong> Create channels to monitor your sources, <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google reader</a> works well, <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> a bit noisy. You want these streams to have a high signal to noise ratio. Don&rsquo;t add pundits or 24-hour tech news into this mix. They are too noisy. Add sources that you know produce great topical content. For me, technology specific tech blogs work best.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Read your channels regularly.</strong> I try to read through my sources at least once per day. Some days there isn&rsquo;t much to learn but other days I have multiple &ldquo;holy cow&rdquo; moments. If this becomes a chore then you might want to look for a new line of work :)</p></li>

    <p>There are times when I have witness (and participated in) arguments about trade-offs between scope and effort. Sometimes developers tend to push back fairly hard with the perception is that the effort is too high for a particular feature change.</p>

<p>Coders can become downright defensive when you are talking about changing the fundamentals of an application. After all, this is their baby and someone just through it out with the bathwater.</p>

<p>As programmers, we need to remember that software is soft. Meaning that it can be changed and it should be changed to conform to whatever the application requirements dictate. We are not talking about destroying a building to change the wall color. We are talking about changing <strong>soft</strong>ware to meet new requirements.</p>

<p>By the way, we are <em>paid</em> to make these changes.</p>

    <p>One of the best things that you can do as a developer is to be equal parts lazy and smart. This is an art that can be mastered to great effect. I don&rsquo;t mean that you should abandon your passion for programming or stop being focused and goal driven. I mean that you should avoid work that is not absolutely necessary. To do that you need to be both lazy and smart in equal parts.</p>

<p>There are pitfalls. Laziness without being smart leads to inaction. Being smart without laziness leads to constantly reinventing the wheel. Ultimately the value you deliver needs to increase as a result of being lazy and smart.</p>

<p>Laziness means that you don&rsquo;t want to do work that is unnecessary. You would rather copy and paste a known good solution rather than write it from scratch. You would rather ask a colleague for a quick answer than search for the same answer for hours. You would rather do a quick prototype rather than spending days in meetings arguing about how the application should look.</p>

<p>Being lazy means that you are constantly looking for <em>congruent efficiency</em>. You want to find a better way to get a goal accomplished with the same quality but less effort. You want to spend more time making great software with great user experiences, and less time doing mundane tasks. Mundane tasks are like the scourge of software development. Luckily new tools and techniques are eliminating mundane tasks but there are still area where you can make significant time savings.</p>

<p>Being smart is the most important part of the equation. If you are just lazy, then you really don&rsquo;t get anywhere quickly. But put lazy and smart together, and you get magic. That elusive balance where you are practically cheating. Things are so easy and yet so effective. Smart makes your laziness seem like genius.</p>

<p>Some Ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Eliminate unnecessary meetings.</strong> Keep meetings short and to the point. Focus meetings on working software with demos.</li>
<li><strong>Have a code library for common patterns.</strong> Copy/paste from the library when you come across a pattern that you have used before. Keep the library up to date with latest practices and new patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage co-workers.</strong> When you have a hard problem, you may be surprised to learn that your colleagues have solved this problem in the past. Ask early in the cycle to avoid duplicate work and potential mistakes based on a potentially flawed approach. Hold code reviews so that you can validate your solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Search the internet.</strong> Sounds silly but I&rsquo;ve seen people plug away at a problem without looking for a solution online first. Google is your friend.</li>
</ul>

    <p>It&rsquo;s funny, I put off writing this post for over a week. That might make me a hypocrite but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the truth is less important. Procrastination is the enemy.</p>

<p>If you want to get something done, start immediately and <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18557776">fail often</a>.</p>

<p>There are a million reasons not to start right away. Maybe you won&rsquo;t be any good at it, or you have more important things to do. Maybe you are just plain scared of judgment from your peers.</p>

<p>The truth is that starting a task is the most important step to finishing a task. If it&rsquo;s something simple then just knock it out quickly. If it&rsquo;s a more complicated task, then engaging your mind is the pathway to completion. Engaging your mind on a particular task acts like a channel, forcing thoughts to form around a central idea. Once your mind is engaged in problem solving there is a very low chance that you will slip on into procrastination.</p>

<p>There are some exceptions to this. When there is a hard problem that I can&rsquo;t seem to solve with conventional methods, I sometimes allow myself to completely forget about the topic altogether. This is not procrastination but rather a way to utilize my sub-conscious mind. My letting the topic ferment in the deep recesses of my mind I can afford</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Clock Problem&rdquo; is an interview question that I have been using for a few years. I first learned about it when I was being interviewed. I have now adopted it as my first line of defense against imposters. :)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple problem that can be used to determine a candidate&rsquo;s capacity for analytical problem solving. The beauty is that the problem has a simple and elegant solution which can be found in less than 10 minutes. More importantly it forces the candidate to think about a problem that he or she has not likely considered before. The problem domain is also easily understood, everyone knows how a clock works.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement:748ed73ae35f87e2d44e98b83303e427">Problem Statement</h3>

<p>Write a function that can compute the angle between the hands of a clock given a time of day. Take your time and think it through, then we will walk-through your solution.</p>

<h3 id="solution:748ed73ae35f87e2d44e98b83303e427">Solution</h3>

<ol>
<li>Deduce that for each hour on the clock there are 30 degrees. 360 degrees divided by 12 hours.</li>
<li>Deduce that for each minute on the clock there are 6 degrees. 360 degrees divided by 60 minutes.</li>
<li>Compute the angle with respect to 12 o&rsquo;clock for both the hour hand and the minute hand. For the hour hand the formula is: hour * 30, for the minute hand: minute * 6</li>
<li>Subtract the hour angle from the minute angle to get the solution. Ensure that the result is less than 180 degrees.</li>
<li>Extra Credit: The hour hand doesn&rsquo;t point directly to the hour, it moves proportionally to the minute value between hours. This can be computed by adding a factor to the hour hand position. This factor is computed based on the minute value and added to the hour hand angle (see solution below).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="full-solution-in-javascript:748ed73ae35f87e2d44e98b83303e427">Full solution in JavaScript</h3>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/ctrl1024/2Mk24/">http://jsfiddle.net/ctrl1024/2Mk24/</a></p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10286010.js"></script>

<h3 id="likely-outcomes:748ed73ae35f87e2d44e98b83303e427">Likely outcomes</h3>

<p>After giving this problem dozens of times, I have noticed responses that roughly fall into these tags:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Candidate goes quiet for about 5 minutes. Then says that he/she would create a lookup table where given an hour or minute, they would retrieve the angle. This is skirting the exercise entirely, my response is that we should take a few minutes and compute some of the lookup values. If this doesn&rsquo;t work then I ask if there is a mathematical way to relate the hand position to an angle.</p></li>

<li><p>Candidate understands that there is a mathematical solution but struggles to find the relationship between hand position and angle. I wait about 10 minutes, then start to give hints like: How many minutes per rotation? How many degrees per rotation? The important thing here is not to give away the solution but just enough information to direct the candidate towards the solution.</p></li>

<li><p>Candidate struggles at each stage. I give small hints and eventually the solution is found. I try to determine if nerves are a factor or if there is a lack of skill. Usually I would pass on the candidate unless there are other factors at play. I may give another coding problem to find a pattern if one exists.</p></li>

<li><p>Candidate gives up after about 10 minutes of floundering. This is a total fail and I usually end the interview politely but quickly.  In my opinion this problem can be solved by 8th grader (without coding) and any developer with some experience should be able to solve.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="conclusion:748ed73ae35f87e2d44e98b83303e427">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This may sound like a simple problem but I believe it really does show analytical ability. Most importantly it allows for discussion and discourse in the context of an interview. This will tell you how the candidate reacts to a real-time challenge.</p>

<p>In my daily work, I lead teams that build software. These are &ldquo;line of business&rdquo; or &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; software systems. I come into contact with a lot of developers, all with differing backgrounds, experience levels and personalities. I see the good and the bad. Pride generally stands out as the most accurate quality indicator of the individual developer.</p>

<p>Having pride in your work makes you want to improve. If you are mindful of the effects that your work has on others, that can only lead to a better career path. First, you need to be self-aware and able to see your work through the eyes of a co-worker. Then you need to have the foresight to adjust your behavior accordingly.</p>

<p>Ask your self these questions, they all show pride in your work:</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-communicate-more-effectively-with-the-team:4087a2688a1790cb7eaab2ddc8ef5304">How can I communicate more effectively with the team?</h3>

<p>Be clear and concise. Don&rsquo;t ramble. Stay on topic, avoid distractions. Drive the conversation forward. Don&rsquo;t speak if you have nothing to say. When you speak, add value. Listen. Yield to the experts. Challenge but don&rsquo;t create conflict. Keep everything on a business level. Take time understand context. Provide context.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-make-my-self-more-valuable-to-the-team:4087a2688a1790cb7eaab2ddc8ef5304">How can I make my self more valuable to the team?</h3>

<p>Follow through on your commitments. Don&rsquo;t get in over your head. Mentor others. Give constructive feedback. Call out issues early. Be proactive. Always give 100%. Be consistent. Take ownership. Take responsibility for mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-i-do-to-help-others-more-easily-discover-the-design-of-this-component:4087a2688a1790cb7eaab2ddc8ef5304">What can I do to help others more easily discover the design of this component?</h3>

<p>Use descriptive variable names (even on private / local members). Add comments to code that is not obviously understood. Use the built-in documentation conventions of your language. Name classes, properties and methods in a <em>logical and consistent</em> way.</p>

<p>All of this ultimately forms your reputation as a developer. All you have is your reputation. I have moved jobs a fews times in my career and I can tell you that having a network of people who are aware of your capabilities is the best possible resource when it&rsquo;s time for job hunting.</p>

    <p>I ran into an interesting problem with Google app engine. It seems that the memcache time limit is enforced differently on the development server versus the production servers.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/FAQ#What_are_the_limits_on_setting_expire_time?_(why_is_there_a_30_d">The documentation</a> says that the time limit for a memcache key is 30 days. The behavior that I have observed is that if you set a memcache key to timeout at 30 days, the development server (on windows) will happily persist the data as expected.</p>

<p>On the production servers, it seems that the behavior is much different. I have notice with a timeout of 30 days, that memcache will not only ignore the persisted key but it will also cause erratic behavior for instances in your application.</p>

<p>Under these conditions a new instance of my application was start for each request! Obviously this adversely effects performance.</p>

<p>Once I changed the memcache timeout to a lesser value (under 30 days), the problem stopped.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I have seen many developers struggle with a growing dilemma, do I devote my time to platform development?</p>

<p>When I say &ldquo;platform development&rdquo; I mean building application on products such as <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">Microsoft SharePoint</a> and <a href="http://crm.dynamics.com/online/default.aspx?tabid=fits-your-business&amp;fbid=gnPbjZqF5wO">Microsoft CRM</a>. The IT world is rapidly moving toward standardizing on platforms such as these. They offer lower IT costs, standardized infrastructure and overall lower cost of ownership. It makes sense from a business perspective, but what do you do as a developer?</p>

<p>The problem here is that we have all been devoting all of our time to becoming better coders, designing systems and generally attacking every problem from the ground up. Not so in the platform world. You begin with a packaged software product, then extend it to meet a customers needs. These extensions can be simply point and click configurations, embedded code such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, or compiled code which changes behavior in the product.</p>

<p>In the new world of platforms, we are asked to live in a box. That box is called a platform. They bring limitations, boundaries and a sense that we can&rsquo;t use all the tools that we have worked so hard to learn and build over the years.</p>

<p>Most of my experience is with <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">Microsoft SharePoint</a> and <a href="http://crm.dynamics.com/online/default.aspx?tabid=fits-your-business&amp;fbid=gnPbjZqF5wO">Microsoft CRM</a> but the trend is industry-wide. IT shops have been burned by custom software and they want some predictability over time. I get it.</p>

<p>Customers generally expect the platform to host a wide range of applications and act as a clearing house for all future development activities. The problem comes in when requirements don&rsquo;t match up to the platforms capabilities. This can be a scale issue, or a mismatch of the smallest detail. These gaps are extremely painful for developers because the client is expecting the fully baked solution, but the platform doesn&rsquo;t entirely deliver. It&rsquo;s up to us to build that last 10% of the solution, which takes 50% of the effort. Blarg!</p>

<p>In other scenarios, the product (particularly <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">SharePoint</a>) is a really &ldquo;big hammer&rdquo; that solves lots of problems and you have no choice but to use the entire platform. For instance, say a client wants Content Management. Well, <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">SharePoint</a> certainly does that, but it also comes with collaboration, profiling, personalization, single sign-on, search, etc. Sometimes it can feel like you boiling the ocean for a cup of tea.</p>

<p>I have struggled to reconcile these issues and come to the conclusion that there are really two options for developers.</p>

<h3 id="first-option:5270f738531673956d3b5b927c5892fc">First Option</h3>

<p>Swallow your pride and start learning a platform. There are a ton of opportunities right now for platform work, that work is not going to end any time soon and you might as well take the plunge sooner than later. There will be some limitations but in return you will get some opportunities that were not possible before.</p>

<p>Usually enterprises have a portfolio of systems, and your project is just one of them. In the platform world you will need to integrate with other systems in a more reliable and sensible way. Sometimes this integration work is custom (cha-ching!) other times it is not. But the point is that the platform allows you to think at a higher level without being mired in minutia of coding all the components yourself. The upside is that you can use you brain cycles to think about solving bigger problems and delivering more value.</p>

<h3 id="second-option:5270f738531673956d3b5b927c5892fc">Second Option</h3>

<p>Punt. Find a product company you want to work for, or a start-up that seems interesting. If you are in consulting there is a majority chance that you will be moved in to a platform role. If that&rsquo;s not where you want to be, get out immediately.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen too many people struggle through the transition. Always battling to get the custom application development work on any project and generally hating life. Don&rsquo;t get swept away in the idealized vision that you can buck the trend. See this transition for what it is to you, either a way to move in a new direction or get out before you cause yourself a lot of heartache.</p>

    <p>I thought it would be nice to see my last tweet on my blog. It turns out that there is an easy way to do this using jquery and the twitter api. These instructions may not work for you if your blogging platform does not allow embedded JavaScript (wordpress.com does not).</p>

<p>To get the tweets for any user in JSON format you can visit <a href="http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline/username.json?callback=?">http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline/username.json?callback=?</a></p>

<p>Where username is the twitter username.</p>

<p>Make sure that you first have jquery included in your page like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=jquery.html"></script>

<p>Then add this script to pull the last tweet for a username:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=pulltweet.html"></script>

<p>Replace techhike with the twitter username that you are interested in.</p>

<p>Next add this markup to your page:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=div.html"></script>

<p>This will act as a container for your last tweet.</p>

<p>As an added bonus I decided to write a little javascript to convert URLs in the tweet to hyperlinks. This mimics the behavior on twitter.com. Also, I added a function that creates hyperlinks for twitter handles such as (@TechHike). This link points to the appropriate profile on twitter.com.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=helpers.html"></script>

<p>The final javascript looks like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=load.html"></script>

<p>Cheers!</p>

    <p>Open data protocol or OData is a new Microsoft technology standard which allows for simple data exchange over a REST style interface. The idea is to create a web based interface for complex data stores and in the process free data from silos. This will in theory create a data utopia complete with bunnies, fairies and a side of mash potatoes.</p>

<p>There are a couple of intriguing facets to this proposition. First, since OData is purely REST based, data is available cross platform and also on the client side. JavaScript is a real possibility as a data consumer, mashups just got a whole lot better. To top it all off, natively you can get data in Atom or JSON formats, making JavaScript a first class consumer.</p>

<p>Secondly, Microsoft has bundled a LINQ provider with the .Net Framework. This makes server side integration a snap. You can literal point to an OData endpoint and start writing a LINQ query against it. Bring on the fairies.</p>

<p>To start out, download LINQPad. LINQPad is a lightweight tool that let&rsquo;s you query a LINQ data source in real-time with minimal setup necessary. It gives you a great interface to run quick LINQ based queries. LINQPad does not require an OData source in fact you can use LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework endpoints among others.</p>

<p>Once you have installed LINQPad, click on new connection. For the data context user &ldquo;WCF Data Service (OData)&rdquo;. For the URI use <a href="http://odata.netflix.com/catalog">http://odata.netflix.com/catalog</a>. That&rsquo;s right the Netflix catalog has an OData interface!</p>

<p>OData sources are broken into top level elements called collections. You can think of collections as two dimensional tables with columns and rows. A column can also represent a relationship between two collections.</p>

<p>You can see that in our Netflix service endpoint there are several collections that define the dimensions tracked within the catalog. Genres, People, Titles, etc. This is where the cool starts. You can now construct LINQ queries against the Netflix catalog by typing some LINQ syntax into the main windows and hitting F5.</p>

<p><img src="/images/image_thumb5.png" alt="" />
</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with LINQ syntax, here are tons of examples:
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336746">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336746</a></p>

<p>To use OData from Visual Studio, open a new project, add a new service reference and paste in the Netflix service endpoint URI. VS will automatically understand that this is an OData service and that it should generate a LINQ context class and all the associated classes that define the data collections and data types.

<p>Now you can code against this new LINQ data source as you would any other. However, watch out for performance. Remember that you have taken an outside dependency into your project, anytime you do this there are inherent risks.</p>

<p>Furthermore, LINQ makes the query process very transparent which means that you can flagrantly throw queries at you data source without regard for impact to the service. Bottom line is, think about what you are doing.  Do I really need to run this extra query? Can I consolidate this data pull into a single query?</p>

    <p>Most people think of programmers as the guys guzzling mountain dew in a dark room where pizza slides under the door at around 6PM and a feature is built by 2AM. Although this is can be the case (we&rsquo;ve all been there), I have found that most of the people that I look up to are not at all like this. More often than not people who have influenced me over the years are people that show a genuine passion for software but also have massive creative energy and a social team mentality to boot. This is a paradox that defies stereotypes. It turns out that creativity is an essential ingredient if you want to make a good software developer.</p>

<p>Starting out a career in technology is a steep mountain and the only way to get anywhere is to start grinding and never stop. It is an endless cycle of solving problems from the most mundane logic games to epic enterprise systems. At some point along the way we start to see patterns and recognize that it is possible to improve this cycle with a little planning and some creative thinking.</p>

<p>Even today, 15 years in, I am still constantly looking to solve that next problem, my brain always straining to fit the puzzle pieces together in a way that will make the picture work. But what is my brain doing deep in the subconscious?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had this thought many times and while I have no real explanation, I have a good feeling that some creativity is at work. What else can explain it? I have experiences. I have facts. The only thing my brain has to do is fit those together in a way that solves the puzzle. In many ways this much more a creative exercise that an analytical exercise. Maybe analytical thinking is irrevocably tied to creativity in ways that we cannot yet understand.</p>

<p>The true challenge as a software developer is to find creative solutions to daily problems. Learning APIs, patterns and systems is easy compared to applying those constructs to solve a real world problem. Creative thinking is what separates that average coder and the brilliant thinkers that bring us innovations that change our lives.</p>

    <p>Data caching is a core concept in the web dominated world that we live in. The premise is that we should not have to go back to retrieve data from a data store for every single web request when the data is unchanged, thereby sharing data across web requests. This offers huge performance advantages because all latency related to data fetching, query processing and transmission is eliminated for requests that use the same data. In the SharePoint world this can be a very valuable technique when querying MOSS page libraries or any data stored in the content database. For high traffic sites, the performance of the SPQuery or SPSiteDataQuery api is not acceptable when executing queries for each request.</p>

<p>The most common data caching implementation is using the HttpContext.Cache collection. This is an ASP.NET facility that allows as an in-memory object cache associated with the ASP.NET application domain (w3wp.exe). For SharePoint applications this cache works great when caching can be scoped to the HttpContext. For applications that need caching that is not scoped based on the HttpContext it is necessary find a different solution. The most common case non-HttpContext caching would be any instance where you are consuming data outside of the ASP.NET context such as SPTimer jobs, stsadm commands, winform applications or console applications. For these cases it is not possible to use the HttpContext cache.</p>

<p>There are a few potential solutions to this problem including using the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/pjohnson/archive/2006/02/06/437559.aspx">HttpRuntime static cache</a>, but the best solution (in my opinion) is to use the SPSite instance as a data cache. The idea is that by using the SPSite.RootWeb.AllProperties hashtable, we can store cached data into the content database for later retrieval. This solves the HttpContext problem because for any application to operate it will need to have a SPSite object to provided context for it&rsquo;s operation no matter where it may be running. Because the SPSite object provides context, the data cache is always available.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the class signatures for my implementation of SPSite data caching. By creating a subclass from this base you can implement application independent caching of any data type. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rapid-tools/source/browse/trunk/Rapid.Tools/Domain/RapidCachedDataAdapterBase.cs">The full implement can be found here</a>.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10284798.js?file=RapidCachedDataAdapterBase.cs"></script>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>GetNativeData() is the only method you must override when creating a subclass.</strong> GetNaiveData() provides data from the native datastore to feed the cache, it is called any time that data needs to be retrieved from the native data store.</li>
<li><strong>Serialization to a string is necessary for all cached data types.</strong> Since SPSite.RootWeb.AllProperties accepts only limited data types (date, int and string), it is necessary for us to convert our data into a string. My default the base class uses the standard XmlSerializer class. If you are caching a data type that is not xml serializable (such as Hashtable, Dictionary &amp; DataTable) then you need to implement the Serialize() and Deserialize() method within your subclass. You can choose to serialize your data any way you like as long as it can be represented as a string.</li>
<li><strong>The CacheTimeoutMinutes property determines how long the cached data will live.</strong> An automatic refresh will be triggered when the timeout period expires. The timeout period is set to 20 minutes by default but you can override this in your subclass.</li>
<li><strong>You need to handle cache invalidation when native data changes.</strong> Cache invalidation is supported by the base class, but it is only called automatically if the cache expires due to a cache timeout. You will need to identify the cases where you would like to invalidate the cache and call InvalidateCache() at the appropriated time. Usually you would invalidate the cache when you detect that data has changed, such as when a user changes a list item. In this case you would need to have a feature receiver to detect the change and call InvalidateCache().</li>
<li><strong>The CachedData property used for data access.</strong> The CachedData property will either load the cache or retrieve the cache depending on the situation. You can use the CachedData property as the single access for data.</li>
<li><strong>Using SPSite.RootWeb.AllProperties does carry a cost.</strong> Because we need to load and manipulate an SPSite object, there is an implied cost associated with this approach. Anytime SPSite is loaded or saved SharePoint needs to communicate with the content database and that takes cycles. This is in sharp contrast to the HttpContext.Cache approach where all data is stored in memory. To mitigate this cost the base class uses the HttpContext.Items collection to cache data for each http request. This means that the SPSite object will only be loaded used once per request.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample subclass:</p>

    <p>When creating custom controls it is often must easier to create a control using
the &ldquo;User Control&rdquo; development model instead of the &ldquo;Server Control&rdquo; model. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zt27tfhy.aspx">Server controls</a> generally have a more &ldquo;low level&rdquo; feel and dictate that the developer build the control&rsquo;s rendering from scratch. Either by building a control tree or by constructing the rendered output in code.</p>

<p>Alternatively <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y6wb1a0e.aspx">user controls</a> have nice separation of code and presentation by virtue of having a markup file (.ascx) and a code behind file; much like a standard aspx page. User controls can be created and developed using the same standard approaches and processes that we all know and love from the aspx page model.</p>

<p>When implementing a custom field control for SharePoint, the development experience can be streamlined to a large degree by utilizing a user control. Traditionally field controls are created using the server control model but with a few tricks you can implement a custom field control with a user control.</p>

<p>First, here is the base class used for the field control. It has a virtual property used to set the user control path. A property override for the value of the field which is read from the user control. On initialization it loads the user control and sets the context.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10280829.js?file=BaseFieldControl.cs"></script>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example field control subclass. This class simply specifies the user control path and let&rsquo;s the base class handle all the details of loading the user control and setting the context. This is the server control that you will embed into you page layouts.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10280829.js?file=UserControlFieldBase.cs"></script>

<p>Next, is the abstract base class for the user control. This class provides a property for a reference to the parent field control and an abstract property for the field value. The field control property is important because our user control will need to know all the information about the field it is attached to. This includes the SPField context and control mode among other things.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10280829.js?file=SPFieldUserControlBase.cs"></script>

<p>Lastly you can create a user control that inherits from the SPFieldUserControlBase class and implement the specific UI that is necessary for you field control to function. See my pervious post on how to create a custom field control for further direction on creating field controls from scratch.
This technique also you to have easiest possible development process while leveraging the SharePoint field control infrastructure. Any questions or comments, please let me know!</p>

<p>As SharePoint becomes more prevalent in the custom application development realm, there has been some friction and malcontent expressed in relation to deployment processes, team development methods and application upgrade paths. I believe that Microsoft has fallen short on providing the tools necessary to promote and support custom application development on the SharePoint platform.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the SharePoint platform should not limit nor impede my ability as a custom application developer to deliver solutions that follow the same deployment principals as any other custom asp.net application. As some readers may be aware, at present the standard Microsoft guidance is flawed because it does not fully support repeatable build processes. This is a huge barrier for custom application developers who are accustom to building applications using source control for all assets, build automation and continuous integration. SharePoint as a lot to offer but taking advantage of the platform as a vehicle for custom applications should be more congruent with standard software development practices.</p>

<h3 id="the-microsoft-approach:eef21bfca27a4a657aef9dd8922e15d2">The Microsoft approach</h3>

<p>The Microsoft approach dictates that for team development environments, artifacts such as aspx, html, css files or any other file that lives in the content database should be created, stored and version controlled in a SharePoint authoring environment. These artifacts are created and maintained by &ldquo;content developers&rdquo;. These content developers use SharePoint designer to create and propagate changes to production.</p>

<p>In parallel, custom application developers are to use standard team development principals (source control, etc) to create assemblies that are then promoted to the authoring environment where they are tested and eventually deployed to the production environment.</p>

<p>Read more:
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb428899.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb428899.aspx</a></p>

<h3 id="where-the-microsoft-approach-falters:eef21bfca27a4a657aef9dd8922e15d2">Where the Microsoft approach falters</h3>

<p>The primary problem with the Microsoft approach is that in many cases there is a <em>hard dependency</em> between artifacts and assemblies. You need to have the same version of artifacts and assemblies to be able to test in any environment and it is not possible get a synchronized version of both sets of assets from a single source. This relegates developers to constantly migrating and updating both content and assemblies to get a consistent version to test. The problem is only compounded because content authors may not be technically able to update assemblies in the authoring environment.</p>

<p>For a custom application of any complexity you need to be able to build and deploy a set of files that work as a unit. For a standard data-driven (SQL Server) asp.net application that means you would have your database creation scripts in source control and when deploying to a new environment (or upgrading an environment), you would run your scripts to create a new copy of the database for that environment. This way, deploying to a test environment becomes easy because you have a repeatable process. Why treat a SharePoint site any differently? You will of course need to use the SharePoint API instead of a SQL database creation script, but the basic function is the same.</p>

<h2 id="a-solution:eef21bfca27a4a657aef9dd8922e15d2">A Solution</h2>

<p>After working with SharePoint for 6+ years I have found that it is possible to treat a SharePoint custom application as you would any other asp.net custom application. The Microsoft tools (and therefore the approach) fall short on these topics but with some motivation and know-how you can achieve substantial benefits by following these steps:</p>

<h3 id="use-spdeploy-http-rapid-tools-googlecode-com:eef21bfca27a4a657aef9dd8922e15d2">Use <a href="http://rapid-tools.googlecode.com">SPDeploy</a></h3>

<p>Ok, this is shamefully self promotional. What I really mean is that you should be using a deployment tool that can support creating customizations inside Visual Studio and deploying those customization via a SharePoint Solution Package (.wsp) to a remote server. There are a few tools that compile a wsp from Visual Studio such as WSPBuilder or Andrew Connell&rsquo;s custom approach. In my opinion SPDeploy is the most complete and easily repeatable solution to solve this problem, but I am biased :)</p>

<h3 id="create-all-your-sharepoint-customizations-inside-visual-studio:eef21bfca27a4a657aef9dd8922e15d2">Create all your SharePoint customizations inside Visual Studio.</h3>

<p>We are custom application developers and we use Visual Studio solutions. This should not change when you are working on a SharePoint project.</p>

<h3 id="use-source-control:eef21bfca27a4a657aef9dd8922e15d2">Use source control</h3>

<p>Because we now have all of our SharePoint customizations inside Visual Studio, the next logical step is to commit that solution to source control. Read more about the benefits of source control:
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173539.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173539.aspx</a></p>

<h3 id="design-your-solution-to-provision-all-site-collection-assets-from-source-control:eef21bfca27a4a657aef9dd8922e15d2">Design your solution to provision all site collection assets from source control</h3>

<p>Provisioning all site collection assets enables you to create your projects site collection from source control at will. This means that when a new developer steps onto your project, he or she can pull a copy of the files from source control and create a site collection that is identical to your site collection. Furthermore because you now have a repeatable site collection provisioning process, when deploying to test you can hand-off your wsp and have a tester create a site instance in no time at all.</p>

<p>Implementing this can be a bit tricky. For a brute force approach you can create a feature that lives at the site level that will provision all sub sites, files, etc. Or if you are adventurous you can create an XML configurable feature that will provision all assets according to a configurable XML file.</p>

<h3 id="use-developer-isolated-environments:eef21bfca27a4a657aef9dd8922e15d2">Use developer isolated environments</h3>

<p>Because we have the infrastructure in place to provision all site collection assets, it is possible to create isolated developer environments. This is the standard development method for any asp.net application and it should not change when developing a custom application on top of SharePoint.</p>

<h3 id="use-continuous-integration:eef21bfca27a4a657aef9dd8922e15d2">Use continuous integration</h3>

<p>This one is somewhat optional but I would strongly recommend using continuous integration on any project. Because of the previous points, continuous integration for a SharePoint project becomes possible. Read more about continuous integration:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration</a></p>

<h3 id="use-sharepoint-designer-only-as-a-immediate-feedback-tool:eef21bfca27a4a657aef9dd8922e15d2">Use SharePoint Designer only as a &ldquo;Immediate Feedback&rdquo; tool</h3>

<p>SharePoint designer should not be used as a primary development tool (as MS suggests) but rather as a tool to quickly and conveniently see changes inside your site instance. Once you are happy with a change, then it should be placed in your Visual Studio solution so that it can participate in source control.</p>

<p>This is usually helpful with rendering assets such as page layouts, XML files, XSLT transforms and stylesheets. It sure is nice to be able to see changes immediately, but be sure to commit your changes to your Visual Studio project (and hence source control) so that they are visible to other developers on the project.</p>
