<p>Hi, I am Clint. I&#8217;m a technology enthusiast, <a href="http://www.cartoonstock.com/directory/s/software_engineer.asp">software developer</a>, father, husband, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun">cajun</a>, worrywart and sometimes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_the_Grouch">grouch</a>. I live in the suburbs of Seattle where I watch <a href="http://www.lsusports.net/"><span class="caps">LSU</span> football</a> and enjoy our annual crawfish boil. I have 2 daughters which leaves me as the only man in the house. Even the dog is female.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I have worked in the technology consulting industry for roughly 15 years as a software engineer and architect. Much of my career has be devoted to Microsoft, building business applications that help to keep the wheels turning in Redmond.</p>
<p>I started out in the early days of the World Wide Web (remember that?!) when Mosaic and Gopher were all the rage. In college I discovered that I could write <span class="caps">PERL</span> scripts on my school account and have those run over the web. I was hooked! I quickly became addicted and that started the career that I have today. I got a web development job during college and that later turned into a software consulting career.</p>
<p>I worked for many years as a generalist doing Classic <span class="caps">ASP</span>, ColdFusion, <span class="caps">ASP</span>.net and <span class="caps">SQL</span> server. I later focused on platforms, spending a few years doing custom application development with SharePoint and most recently working with Dynamics <span class="caps">CRM</span>.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I&#8217;ve built a bunch of <a href="#projects">side projects</a>. Most are toys that I have used to feed my coding addiction. Some are useful and others aren&#8217;t. I had fun building all of them.</p>
<p>If you are interested in more information about my work, <a href="/resume">take a look at my resume</a>.</p>
<h2>Play</h2>
<p>Outside of work I love guitar, golf, football and being a dad to my 2 daughters. <a href="http://cajunjourneymen.com">Hiking is also a passion</a>. I ran <a href="/2011/07/01/first-marathon-complete">my first marathon</a> on June 26, 2011 in a time of 4 hours and 55 minutes.</p>
<p style="float:right;"><img src="/images/crossfit_afro.jpg" style="width: 200px;" alt="" /></p>
<p>My most recent addiction is <a href="http://games.crossfit.com">Crossfit</a>. After about an 18 year hiatus from organized physical activity, I started Crossfit in July of 2011. For the first 3 months I proceeded to try my hardest but constantly felt like a used dish towel. I stuck with it and I have seen huge improvement in my physical fitness level. Although the path is difficult, I would not change a thing.</p>

<h3><a href="http://code.google.com/p/rapid-tools/">Rapid Tools for SharePoint</a></h3>
<p>Rapid Tools for SharePoint 2007 is a set of developer tools that are dedicated to making SharePoint developers more productive. Rapid tools enables developers to build SharePoint custom applications using the full Software Development Life Cycle (<span class="caps">SDLC</span>). Traditionally using the <span class="caps">SDL</span> with the SharePoint platform has been a painful and awkward process, but with Rapid Tools for SharePoint, application developers are now in full control of SharePoint development and deployment in a way that was not possible before.</p>
