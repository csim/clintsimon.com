# *Experience.* Nothing trumps experience. The more times you are "at-bat", the more lessons you learn. Particularly experience at progressively higher levels responsibility is desirable. Challenging yourself is ultimately the only way to grow and learn.
# *Technology aptitude.* I necessarily mean reciting minute technical details from memory. I mean _understand_ the underlying principles of technology. Abstraction, service oriented architecture, componentization, dependency injection, user experience design. Deep understand of these topics are what separates the great consultants from the rest.
# *Consulting IQ.* Soft skill are where we make our money. Reading a room, understanding the motivations involved, working toward a common goal while avoiding or minimizing conflicts. These are things that a consultant does every day. It is hard to judge this quality 
# *Confidence.*
# *Inquisitive nature.* Every single person on this planet should be constantly asking questions and learning. If the candidate is not asking questions (and hopefully intelligent questions), how can I hope to send that person into an unknown client situation and expect good results?
# *Personality and likability.* Ultimately our clients are people and people form relationships with others and those relationships affect important decisions. Likability goes a long way toward forging relationships. Simple things, like mentioning a hobby or sharing a laugh about some common interest can add up to extremely valuable relationships over time. Some of this comes from simply liking what you do for a living, but I think mostly it comes from a positive outlook.
# *Honesty.* Look, I know that things go sideways on projects. In fact, I would venture to say that every single project has a "sideways" phase at some point in the process. An honest candidate will 
# *Perspective.*

Both big and small decisions are made based on the confidence that out client has in the team


Deal breakers:

# *Candidate is too nervous to talk.*
# *I don't hear excitement.*
