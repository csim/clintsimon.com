Lately I have been learning about "Git":http://git-scm.org and "GitHub":http://github.com. Most of this work is done at the command line, I have found myself quickly amassing PowerShell functions that acts as shortcuts.

One very handy shortcut is the ability to launch the "sublime text editor":http://www.sublimetext.com and open the current directory as a project. Or alternately passing in a file to edit.


{% highlight powershell%}
function Edit { 
    $SublimePath = "{your path}\sublime_text.exe"
    if ($args.length -eq 0) {
        & $SublimePath $pwd
    } else {
        & $SublimePath $args 
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Once this function is in your powershell profile, just type "edit" at the command prompt and sublime will open the current folder.
