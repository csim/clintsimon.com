I just started to use a new service that allows you to automate your social life. It's called "If this then that" ([http://ifttt.com](http://ifttt.com)). 

You can setup rules that says things like, if I post a link to twitter then create link post on Facebook. Or, if someone tags me in a picture on Facebook, copy that photo to my dropbox account. These are just a couple of the thousands of possibilities. Serivices can be combined in a multitude of cominations, these even include phone, sms and email.

How would you like to save a voice message to your dropbox by calling ifttt.com? That's possible.

I've done some experiments and found the service to be relatively fast but not exactly "realtime".  Most of the time processing happens within about 10 minutes.
