I have been doing work with [Boostrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com) as of late. When build responsive layouts, I find it very handy to immediately see which predefined size group you are currently viewing. Hereâ€™s little snippet that shows the current Bootstrap size modifier.

This is especially helpful when view a page from a mobile device or table. You can easily deduce which size group maps to a particular device in each orientation.
