    <p>I&rsquo;m not a long-term planner. I&rsquo;ve never made a &ldquo;5 year plan&rdquo; or thought about where I want to be 10 years from now. I simply look at what my options are and make a decision about what to do next.</p>

<p>I only learned to code because my dad needed a problem solved. He ran a consulting business where he needed to perform regular equipment maintenance. It was 1996 and the web was new. It seemed like it might be possible to track schedules and log maintenance activities via the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>I was young and foolish, so I started right away. I knew very little about programming having only built very simple programs in basic on my commodore 64 roughly 10 years earlier. I picked Perl because it was available with my college computer lab account which was the right price (free). I could also expose the script to the web, score!</p>

<p>Looking back, I was a pretty awful programmer at that time. I had about 5 tricks in my bag and writing a function was not one of them. The Perl script became one long if statement with print statements to emit HTML. Around 800 lines of code with no functions. Wow, does this seem backwards to me now. To top it off, I wrote a rudimentary serialization process to save my in-memory HashTable to a text file.</p>

<p>To be fair, I did not know the word &ldquo;serialization&rdquo; at the time. I just knew that I needed to save some data and have it available on the next web request. I happily wrote some code at the end of my script to store the text file after each request was rendered and some code at the top to read the file. Done.</p>

<p>I was absolutely intoxicated by the process of coding my first web application. I literally could not get enough. I worked on the script with every sliver of free time that I had and when I wasn&rsquo;t working on it, I was thinking about it or dreaming about it.</p>

<p>How could I get this element to render? How could I get the code to run faster? What do I do with this data? Can I build a calendar?</p>

<p>I was great. I probably learned more in those 6 weeks than at any other time in my career. But more than that, it forged my desire to be a programmer. I am still chasing the high that I felt over 15 years ago on the first project. There is nothing like having an idea, building it and watching it grow into something valuable.</p>

<p>That little application that I built went on to run a substantial part of my dad&rsquo;s business for a few years until I replaced it with a new version that was more professional. It was great to see it work for so long but the larger net effect was that I was hooked on coding. I haven&rsquo;t looked back once.</p>

    <p>Over the past year or so, my career has taken a turn toward what I would call &ldquo;pure consulting&rdquo; or put more plainly, &ldquo;giving people my opinion&rdquo;. During this time I really hadn&rsquo;t written any code to speak of, minus some small side projects. There just wasn&rsquo;t a need for it and frankly I had my hands full.</p>

<p>All that changed when I started a new project and took ownership of a large chunk of functionality. As the development lead I sure as hell wanted to get my hands dirty with the code, setup the framework, etc. So I jumped in head first and started coding.</p>

<p>I honestly forgot how cool it is to code something from scratch and see it grow from an idea to a fully functional application. It was total invigorating to see things take shape and evolve, each step of the way becoming more intricate and complex.</p>

<p>I never get tired of the code manipulation cycle. Making a code change, seeing the result and making another change, over and over again. It&rsquo;s just one of those things that never gets old. It really feels like a disease is some ways. Your mind is consumed, all your thoughts spent strategizing on the next set of changes and thinking of the long term implications.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a skill that feels intrinsic, not a learned behavior but something must have been inside you from the beginning. How lucky am I that I get paid to do this? Pretty cool.</p>

    <p>It appears that <a href="http://crm.dynamics.com">Dynamics CRM Online</a> does not play well with Internet Explorer 10. In fact, it downright does not work with IE10. Many of the web dialogs are unusable and when you receive an error, the error dialog exhibits bazaar behavior.</p>

<p>This is an absolute tragedy. Windows 8 launched 3 weeks ago with IE10 included and the Dynamics product team was not prepared. The user experience on a windows 8 machine for Dynamics CRM is basically unusable.</p>

<p>However, there is an easy way to fix this. For IE10, hit ALT. Then go to Tools -&gt; Compatibility View Settings.</p>

<div class="vinette">
<img src="/images/ie10_1.png" width="325" height="514" />
</div>

<p>Then add your CRM Online URL to the list. Below I am using the default dynamics.com domain. This will force IE10 to render the CRM application in compatibility mode.</p>

<div class="vinette">
<img src="/images/ie10_2.png" width="391" height="488" />
</div>

<p>Maybe Microsoft should make dynamics.com automatically render in compatibility mode? Or would that be too big of a black eye?</p>

    <p>Learning new technologies and techniques is a part of life for any software developer. Programming is a quest for knowledge and understanding which lasts your entire lifetime. No other profession has a more dynamic working environment. Tools change and evolve on a daily basis it seems.  Learning is incumbent on all developers. Darwin&rsquo;s law applies, adapt or perish.</p>

<p>Luckily most of us are used to this environment and thrive on the constantly changing landscape. I have found over my career that the pace of change has only increased, particularly in the past few years. The move to cloud computing is a big driver and the open source movement is creating a climate of rapid discovery and change. Thousands of new approaches to old problems are being forged this very moment.</p>

<p>Benefits can be reaped if you are efficient with your time and energy. Your value as an employee can be traced back to your technology aptitude and that aptitude is greatly affected by your knowledge of the technology spectrum which you apply to a project. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you need to have the deepest knowledge on a particular technology but instead you need a broad view of how technology fits together and how to choose the right pieces to solve a problem. Suggesting the pieces can be more important that understanding how each pieces works.</p>

<p>Generally I try to follow a few key rules which keep me in touch with new technology:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Find quality sources.</strong> Find the best possible sources which apply to the technology space where you work. Each source should have excellent content covering a set of topics that could potentially apply to your daily work.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Organize the channels.</strong> Create channels to monitor your sources, <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google reader</a> works well, <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> a bit noisy. You want these streams to have a high signal to noise ratio. Don&rsquo;t add pundits or 24-hour tech news into this mix. They are too noisy. Add sources that you know produce great topical content. For me, technology specific tech blogs work best.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Read your channels regularly.</strong> I try to read through my sources at least once per day. Some days there isn&rsquo;t much to learn but other days I have multiple &ldquo;holy cow&rdquo; moments. If this becomes a chore then you might want to look for a new line of work :)</p></li>

    <p>There are times when I have witness (and participated in) arguments about trade-offs between scope and effort. Sometimes developers tend to push back fairly hard with the perception is that the effort is too high for a particular feature change.</p>

<p>Coders can become downright defensive when you are talking about changing the fundamentals of an application. After all, this is their baby and someone just through it out with the bathwater.</p>

<p>As programmers, we need to remember that software is soft. Meaning that it can be changed and it should be changed to conform to whatever the application requirements dictate. We are not talking about destroying a building to change the wall color. We are talking about changing <strong>soft</strong>ware to meet new requirements.</p>

<p>By the way, we are <em>paid</em> to make these changes.</p>

    <p>One of the best things that you can do as a developer is to be equal parts lazy and smart. This is an art that can be mastered to great effect. I don&rsquo;t mean that you should abandon your passion for programming or stop being focused and goal driven. I mean that you should avoid work that is not absolutely necessary. To do that you need to be both lazy and smart in equal parts.</p>

<p>There are pitfalls. Laziness without being smart leads to inaction. Being smart without laziness leads to constantly reinventing the wheel. Ultimately the value you deliver needs to increase as a result of being lazy and smart.</p>

<p>Laziness means that you don&rsquo;t want to do work that is unnecessary. You would rather copy and paste a known good solution rather than write it from scratch. You would rather ask a colleague for a quick answer than search for the same answer for hours. You would rather do a quick prototype rather than spending days in meetings arguing about how the application should look.</p>

<p>Being lazy means that you are constantly looking for <em>congruent efficiency</em>. You want to find a better way to get a goal accomplished with the same quality but less effort. You want to spend more time making great software with great user experiences, and less time doing mundane tasks. Mundane tasks are like the scourge of software development. Luckily new tools and techniques are eliminating mundane tasks but there are still area where you can make significant time savings.</p>

<p>Being smart is the most important part of the equation. If you are just lazy, then you really don&rsquo;t get anywhere quickly. But put lazy and smart together, and you get magic. That elusive balance where you are practically cheating. Things are so easy and yet so effective. Smart makes your laziness seem like genius.</p>

<p>Some Ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Eliminate unnecessary meetings.</strong> Keep meetings short and to the point. Focus meetings on working software with demos.</li>
<li><strong>Have a code library for common patterns.</strong> Copy/paste from the library when you come across a pattern that you have used before. Keep the library up to date with latest practices and new patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage co-workers.</strong> When you have a hard problem, you may be surprised to learn that your colleagues have solved this problem in the past. Ask early in the cycle to avoid duplicate work and potential mistakes based on a potentially flawed approach. Hold code reviews so that you can validate your solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Search the internet.</strong> Sounds silly but I&rsquo;ve seen people plug away at a problem without looking for a solution online first. Google is your friend.</li>

    <p>It&rsquo;s funny, I put off writing this post for over a week. That might make me a hypocrite but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the truth is less important. Procrastination is the enemy.</p>

<p>If you want to get something done, start immediately and <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18557776">fail often</a>.</p>

<p>There are a million reasons not to start right away. Maybe you won&rsquo;t be any good at it, or you have more important things to do. Maybe you are just plain scared of judgment from your peers.</p>

<p>The truth is that starting a task is the most important step to finishing a task. If it&rsquo;s something simple then just knock it out quickly. If it&rsquo;s a more complicated task, then engaging your mind is the pathway to completion. Engaging your mind on a particular task acts like a channel, forcing thoughts to form around a central idea. Once your mind is engaged in problem solving there is a very low chance that you will slip on into procrastination.</p>

<p>There are some exceptions to this. When there is a hard problem that I can&rsquo;t seem to solve with conventional methods, I sometimes allow myself to completely forget about the topic altogether. This is not procrastination but rather a way to utilize my sub-conscious mind. My letting the topic ferment in the deep recesses of my mind I can afford</p>

    <p>You have been working here for about 3 years. Life is good. You come in as late as you like and leave late because the work is challenging and rewarding. No one is watching over your shoulder, most days you sling code until your mind goes numb. At any moment a nerf gun war can break out in the office. When Halo 3 was released, all work stopped and there was an all-nighter in the game room. Company parties are amazing, the Christmas party was at a rock-n-roll museum last year and you have an annual company awards ceremony at a hot night club.</p>

<p>The company has been growing at a rapid rate.  The employee count has doubled in the past year and the year before that it almost tripled. There are about 20 new people joining the company each month. Extending this growth out over the next couple of years, you can&rsquo;t help but think that the company will be a huge player in the market. Can we go public? Won&rsquo;t we all be rich?</p>

<p>One fine day, you notice that there are a few new people who just aren&rsquo;t fitting in. They come from larger competitors. Their idea of productivity is waving their hands in meetings talking about &ldquo;enterprise scale&rdquo; and &ldquo;web 2.0&rdquo;. Some others are clearly sub-par coders, quality is suffering. What is going on? You brush it off and continue with your daily routine.</p>

<p>Over time, you realize that the company has made some bad bets. It turns out that those misfit new hires where actually making two times what they were delivering in value. Those Christmas parties and award ceremonies cost in the millions of dollars. Worse yet, the company is insolvent, living off debt and investments my a lone angel investor. Wow, look how far this place has fallen. Your morale fads, this is not fun anymore. What are you going to do? You love this place and you can&rsquo;t bare to start looking for another job when all you friends work here.</p>

<p>This is a story all to familiar to anyone who has been around the consulting industry for a number of years. All to quickly the company that you grew to love changes right underneath your feet. Who is to blame? How did this happen?</p>

<p>This is part of the journey and an opportunity to do some growing up. First and foremost, understand that your beloved company is a <em>business</em>. And businesses have to make money or they don&rsquo;t exist for very long. You may have become emotionally attach to the company and assumed that you would work here in perpetuity, having fun with your friends. Reality is that unless a service business is run at a profit sooner or later it bites the dust.</p>

<p>The interesting part is that morale has a large influence on the trajectory that a company takes. In the beginning morale acts as a buoy, lifting the company to new heights. Good morale is contagious, each new person that enters the company is quickly infected with enthusiasm as soon as they walk in the door. You recruit your friends, everyone is cheerful and bright. Clients see this and are drawn to your energy and zest for details. Bottom line is that everyone believes in the company and you are all working towards a higher goal: your collective professional happiness.</p>

<p>The opposite is true in the declining phase of a company. No one wants to put in the extra effort that was once automatic. Meetings are pure hell, distrust in management is normal, projects fail, pride is lost. Bad morale is even more contagious. People love to complain and focus on the negatives.</p>

<p>Looking back at my career, I can say that I have been through this cycle at least 3 times. During the first 2, I had no idea what was happening. The last one I understood and tried to divorce myself from the situation by taking a clinical approach. I&rsquo;ve learned that this is the cycle of life at small consulting companies. You cannot change it or expect different results with the same inputs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Clock Problem&rdquo; is an interview question that I have been using for a few years. I first learned about it when I was being interviewed. I have now adopted it as my first line of defense against imposters. :)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple problem that can be used to determine a candidate&rsquo;s capacity for analytical problem solving. The beauty is that the problem has a simple and elegant solution which can be found in less than 10 minutes. More importantly it forces the candidate to think about a problem that he or she has not likely considered before. The problem domain is also easily understood, everyone knows how a clock works.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement:748ed73ae35f87e2d44e98b83303e427">Problem Statement</h3>

<p>Write a function that can compute the angle between the hands of a clock given a time of day. Take your time and think it through, then we will walk-through your solution.</p>

<li>Deduce that for each hour on the clock there are 30 degrees. 360 degrees divided by 12 hours.</li>
<li>Deduce that for each minute on the clock there are 6 degrees. 360 degrees divided by 60 minutes.</li>
<li>Compute the angle with respect to 12 o&rsquo;clock for both the hour hand and the minute hand. For the hour hand the formula is: hour * 30, for the minute hand: minute * 6</li>
<li>Subtract the hour angle from the minute angle to get the solution. Ensure that the result is less than 180 degrees.</li>
<li>Extra Credit: The hour hand doesn&rsquo;t point directly to the hour, it moves proportionally to the minute value between hours. This can be computed by adding a factor to the hour hand position. This factor is computed based on the minute value and added to the hour hand angle (see solution below).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="likely-outcomes:748ed73ae35f87e2d44e98b83303e427">Likely outcomes</h3>

<p>After giving this problem dozens of times, I have noticed responses that roughly fall into these tags:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Candidate goes quiet for about 5 minutes. Then says that he/she would create a lookup table where given an hour or minute, they would retrieve the angle. This is skirting the exercise entirely, my response is that we should take a few minutes and compute some of the lookup values. If this doesn&rsquo;t work then I ask if there is a mathematical way to relate the hand position to an angle.</p></li>

<li><p>Candidate understands that there is a mathematical solution but struggles to find the relationship between hand position and angle. I wait about 10 minutes, then start to give hints like: How many minutes per rotation? How many degrees per rotation? The important thing here is not to give away the solution but just enough information to direct the candidate towards the solution.</p></li>

<li><p>Candidate struggles at each stage. I give small hints and eventually the solution is found. I try to determine if nerves are a factor or if there is a lack of skill. Usually I would pass on the candidate unless there are other factors at play. I may give another coding problem to find a pattern if one exists.</p></li>

<li><p>Candidate gives up after about 10 minutes of floundering. This is a total fail and I usually end the interview politely but quickly.  In my opinion this problem can be solved by 8th grader (without coding) and any developer with some experience should be able to solve.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="conclusion:748ed73ae35f87e2d44e98b83303e427">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This may sound like a simple problem but I believe it really does show analytical ability. Most importantly it allows for discussion and discourse in the context of an interview. This will tell you how the candidate reacts to a real-time challenge.</p>

<p>In my daily work, I lead teams that build software. These are &ldquo;line of business&rdquo; or &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; software systems. I come into contact with a lot of developers, all with differing backgrounds, experience levels and personalities. I see the good and the bad. Pride generally stands out as the most accurate quality indicator of the individual developer.</p>

<p>Having pride in your work makes you want to improve. If you are mindful of the effects that your work has on others, that can only lead to a better career path. First, you need to be self-aware and able to see your work through the eyes of a co-worker. Then you need to have the foresight to adjust your behavior accordingly.</p>

<p>Ask your self these questions, they all show pride in your work:</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-communicate-more-effectively-with-the-team:4087a2688a1790cb7eaab2ddc8ef5304">How can I communicate more effectively with the team?</h3>

<p>Be clear and concise. Don&rsquo;t ramble. Stay on topic, avoid distractions. Drive the conversation forward. Don&rsquo;t speak if you have nothing to say. When you speak, add value. Listen. Yield to the experts. Challenge but don&rsquo;t create conflict. Keep everything on a business level. Take time understand context. Provide context.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-make-my-self-more-valuable-to-the-team:4087a2688a1790cb7eaab2ddc8ef5304">How can I make my self more valuable to the team?</h3>

<p>Follow through on your commitments. Don&rsquo;t get in over your head. Mentor others. Give constructive feedback. Call out issues early. Be proactive. Always give 100%. Be consistent. Take ownership. Take responsibility for mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-i-do-to-help-others-more-easily-discover-the-design-of-this-component:4087a2688a1790cb7eaab2ddc8ef5304">What can I do to help others more easily discover the design of this component?</h3>

<p>Use descriptive variable names (even on private / local members). Add comments to code that is not obviously understood. Use the built-in documentation conventions of your language. Name classes, properties and methods in a <em>logical and consistent</em> way.</p>

<p>All of this ultimately forms your reputation as a developer. All you have is your reputation. I have moved jobs a fews times in my career and I can tell you that having a network of people who are aware of your capabilities is the best possible resource when it&rsquo;s time for job hunting.</p>
