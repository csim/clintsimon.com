<p>There are a million and one ways to backup files from your hard drive. For me, the most important things are making sure that the files that cannot be replaced are safe.</p>

<p>Rather than opt for a relatively complicated system image based backup system such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx">Windows Home Server</a> or a automated file copy utility such <a href="https://www.sugarsync.com/">SugarSync</a>, I instead prefer good old fashioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy">Robocopy</a> and physical DVD media. This might sound archaic in the age of cloud computing but I have found it to be the best way to ensure that I will not lose the most important files and have the least amount of headaches.</p>

<h3 id="my-setup:11f6dbaeda945b330401dc8c51a0a477">My setup</h3>

<p>I have a portable 1TB drive which holds all of my media and working files. This includes family pictures, videos and virtual machines. I also have a non-portable 1TB drive that I use for only backups.</p>

<p>For everyday files like word docs, excel spreadsheets, etc. I use <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. These files are important enough that I want then accessible anywhere, anytime but they are not important enough to warrant a physical copy on DVD. <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> is great for this purpose, but it&rsquo;s a big pricey when you go above the 2GB free limit. It runs $99 for 50GB/year and $199 for 100GB/year.</p>

<h3 id="my-strategy:11f6dbaeda945b330401dc8c51a0a477">My strategy</h3>

<p>Once a week I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy">Robocopy</a> to backup all important files from my laptop and the portable drive to the backup drive. When a backup is done, all important files are duplicated to the desktop drive. This covers the potential case where my portable drive is either lost or stolen.</p>

<p>Once a month I copy all the very important files to physical DVD discs. These include family photos and videos. I use <a href="http://hcidesign.com/dvdspan/">DVDSpan</a> to burn a set of folders a set of DVD discs. This utility is rather old but it is very useful and has worked fantastically for me. It takes a folder or set of folders and writes them across a set of DVD discs. Granted this won&rsquo;t work if you have hundreds of Gigabytes to backup.</p>

<p>In my case I am only looking to backup around 50GB of media files. To make things even easier the media files don&rsquo;t change over time. once a file is archive, it does not need to be archived again.</p>

<p>Then writing files using <a href="http://hcidesign.com/dvdspan/">DVDSpan</a>, it helps to have the files organized into date folders. For example /Photos/2011/2011-01. This way when it&rsquo;s time to write DVDs, I can simply burn the recent files that have not been archived and ignore the files that I have already archived.</p>

<p>The new discs get sent to the safe-deposit box for safe keeping. I have researched various methods of storing files off site such as <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> or <a href="http://www.keepvault.com/">KeepVault</a>. So far nothing beats driving down to the safe deposit box at the local bank. I have around 60GB of Gigabytes of photos and videos, but the net new data is less than 10GB per month. That means that I can get away with burning roughly 2 DVD discs for each month.</p>

<p>As cloud backup system mature, I may change my approach but for now I&rsquo;m staying old school.</p>

    <p>I thought it would be nice to see my last tweet on my blog. It turns out that there is an easy way to do this using jquery and the twitter api. These instructions may not work for you if your blogging platform does not allow embedded JavaScript (wordpress.com does not).</p>

<p>To get the tweets for any user in JSON format you can visit <a href="http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline/username.json?callback=?">http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline/username.json?callback=?</a></p>

<p>Where username is the twitter username.</p>

<p>Make sure that you first have jquery included in your page like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=jquery.html"></script>

<p>Then add this script to pull the last tweet for a username:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=pulltweet.html"></script>

<p>Replace techhike with the twitter username that you are interested in.</p>

<p>Next add this markup to your page:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=div.html"></script>

<p>This will act as a container for your last tweet.</p>

<p>As an added bonus I decided to write a little javascript to convert URLs in the tweet to hyperlinks. This mimics the behavior on twitter.com. Also, I added a function that creates hyperlinks for twitter handles such as (@TechHike). This link points to the appropriate profile on twitter.com.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=helpers.html"></script>

<p>The final javascript looks like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=load.html"></script>

<p>Cheers!</p>

    <p>Google&rsquo;s chrome browser is quickly gaining momentum and market share. Recently it has even been projected the before the end of 2011 chrome will surpass firefox as the second most used browser, behind Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think is great about Google Chrome:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It gets out of your way</strong>. As the name indicates, the browser is not in your way at all. The content is front and center and the browser is an afterthought.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent JavaScript performance</strong>. JavaScript has become the way all web applications are written. <em>In practice</em>, chrome has the best JavaScript performance that I have seen. It blows away Internet explorer, event IE9 (although IE9 has come a long way).</li>
<li><strong>The release schedule rocks.</strong> Major versions are released every 6 months and the upgrade process is completely seamless. Chrome is already on version 14. Granted the major releases are not as major as a new IE release, but it is clear that Google is committed to an aggressive release schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Great development tools</strong>. The developer tools in Chrome are second only to <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>. That&rsquo;s saying a lot, firebug is incredible but Chrome is a close second. In some ways I like Chrome better, especially the DOM explorer.</li>
<li><strong>Sync everything</strong>. All browser settings, bookmarks and passwords can be stored in the Google cloud. If you roam across machines or rebuild your machines often, this is a big time saver.</li>
<li><strong>HTML5 and CSS3 support</strong>. Support for new technologies is great in Chrome, thanks in part to the fact that it is built on top of the popular open source <a href="http://www.webkit.org/">WebKit</a> framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is interesting in a lot of ways. First, Google is not generally thought of as a desktop software company. This is changing and Chrome is a part of that.</p>

<p>For Google, Chrome is strategic in that it gives Google some control (and consistency) over how their services are presented on the desktop. Google is a web software company and Chrome is an attempt at controlling the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile">last mile</a>&rdquo; problem. This is important as it gives Google a foot hold on the desktop and a fighting chance against Microsoft.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/chromebook/">Chromebooks</a> are also an interesting concept. A computer that is basically just a browser, in a lightweight package. Chrome is obviously a huge part of these machines and Google is banking on the fact that Chrome can become an everyday part of your web experience.</p>
