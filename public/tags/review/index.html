    <p>Google&rsquo;s chrome browser is quickly gaining momentum and market share. Recently it has even been projected the before the end of 2011 chrome will surpass firefox as the second most used browser, behind Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think is great about Google Chrome:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It gets out of your way</strong>. As the name indicates, the browser is not in your way at all. The content is front and center and the browser is an afterthought.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent JavaScript performance</strong>. JavaScript has become the way all web applications are written. <em>In practice</em>, chrome has the best JavaScript performance that I have seen. It blows away Internet explorer, event IE9 (although IE9 has come a long way).</li>
<li><strong>The release schedule rocks.</strong> Major versions are released every 6 months and the upgrade process is completely seamless. Chrome is already on version 14. Granted the major releases are not as major as a new IE release, but it is clear that Google is committed to an aggressive release schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Great development tools</strong>. The developer tools in Chrome are second only to <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>. That&rsquo;s saying a lot, firebug is incredible but Chrome is a close second. In some ways I like Chrome better, especially the DOM explorer.</li>
<li><strong>Sync everything</strong>. All browser settings, bookmarks and passwords can be stored in the Google cloud. If you roam across machines or rebuild your machines often, this is a big time saver.</li>
<li><strong>HTML5 and CSS3 support</strong>. Support for new technologies is great in Chrome, thanks in part to the fact that it is built on top of the popular open source <a href="http://www.webkit.org/">WebKit</a> framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is interesting in a lot of ways. First, Google is not generally thought of as a desktop software company. This is changing and Chrome is a part of that.</p>

<p>For Google, Chrome is strategic in that it gives Google some control (and consistency) over how their services are presented on the desktop. Google is a web software company and Chrome is an attempt at controlling the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile">last mile</a>&rdquo; problem. This is important as it gives Google a foot hold on the desktop and a fighting chance against Microsoft.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/chromebook/">Chromebooks</a> are also an interesting concept. A computer that is basically just a browser, in a lightweight package. Chrome is obviously a huge part of these machines and Google is banking on the fact that Chrome can become an everyday part of your web experience.</p>

    <p><a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a> launched in the U.S. on July 14th. Given the hoopla around the service I decided to give it a try. Spotify is a music service that allows users to stream or download music, includes social integration and has support for offline listening. Many people have raved about the service in Europe and there has been a constant chorus for an american launch.</p>

<p>After 5 days of use, here&rsquo;s my impressions:</p>

<p>Great value. You get all the music you can handle, offline downloading (including offline for iPhone) for just $10 a month. That is fantastic. I have found that most if not all of the music I care about is available. Spotify has deals with all the major labels, so there is a good chance that it will always have the latest music. There is also a $5 per month option when doesn&rsquo;t allow offline listening and a free ad supported version.</p>

<p>Version 1 application. The Spotify application for windows is good, fast and stable. It is lacking features though. There is no drill down-down by artist or album. Come on, that is obvious and available in all competing products.</p>

<p>I would say the social integration is fairly simple as well. You can see all your Facebook friends who have a Spotify account and view their shared playlists. This seems like the simplest possible social implementation.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that Spotify needs to catch up to Zune and iTunes in terms of features for desktop.</p>

<p>Fast! I have found that playback is extremely fast and reliable. Streaming is particularly good, you mostly can&rsquo;t tell that a song is streaming at all. Playback of streaming is almost as good as local playback. Skipping and scrubbing are instantaneous, searches are</p>

<p>Many people, including Sean Parker (who is a Spotify investor) say that Spotify is the anwser to music piracy. I think that Spotify has a lot of potential and will be very popular in the short term but it remains to be seen who will win the cloud music wars.</p>
