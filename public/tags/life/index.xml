      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny, I put off writing this post for over a week. That might make me a hypocrite but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that the truth is less important. Procrastination is the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get something done, start immediately and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.economist.com/node/18557776&#34;&gt;fail often&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a million reasons not to start right away. Maybe you won&amp;rsquo;t be any good at it, or you have more important things to do. Maybe you are just plain scared of judgment from your peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that starting a task is the most important step to finishing a task. If it&amp;rsquo;s something simple then just knock it out quickly. If it&amp;rsquo;s a more complicated task, then engaging your mind is the pathway to completion. Engaging your mind on a particular task acts like a channel, forcing thoughts to form around a central idea. Once your mind is engaged in problem solving there is a very low chance that you will slip on into procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some exceptions to this. When there is a hard problem that I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to solve with conventional methods, I sometimes allow myself to completely forget about the topic altogether. This is not procrastination but rather a way to utilize my sub-conscious mind. My letting the topic ferment in the deep recesses of my mind I can afford&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Good Addictions</title>
      <link>http://clintsimon.com/blog/2012/2012-10-07-Good-Addictions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I can remember I have been an addict. Over the years my addictions have come and gone. But one thing has always remained: I have an addictive personality. Luckily for me all my addictions have been mostly productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started when I got my first computer, the Commodore 64. At the age of 10 I got the C64 for Christmas and soon after I learned the BASIC programming language so that I could study my Spanish vocabulary words. I know that sounds strange, and it probably is. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it yet but I would soon be spending more time coding the Spanish test than learning the Spanish words. It was the first addiction in a long string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in college, I discovered the World Wide Web (remember that?) and my addictive personality struck again. I started to build an application in Perl 3, and before I knew it I was in deep. This time it was much worse. I started to skip class to build the application. Luckily the skills that I formed during that time have served me well but the truth is that I really had no self-control or cognizant influence. Once I started to build that app, the runaway train had left the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a burning in my gut that I could not quench. The cycle of changing the script and seeing the results was like a drug. Over and over and over I would pound at the keyboard and wait for the results like a junkie waits for the next hit. It was hypnotic and I was absolutely hooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming has taught me so much throughout my life. Persistent, dedication, thoughtfulness, selflessness. And it all started with that Perl script which I stumbled into. There is still something so pure about making the computer do exactly what you want it to do. &lt;em&gt;Today this fire is still burning within me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not the end of the story. After my career became stable, I found other outlets. First it was gaming. StarCraft, Quake/Quakeworld and later World of Warcraft. It was the same, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get enough. There was always more to accomplish, mountains to climb and opponents to vanquish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings us to my latest addiction. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crossfit.com&#34;&gt;Crossfit&lt;/a&gt;. All I want to do is exercise, which is strange. After being an athlete in high school I seldom had any meaningful physical activity (outside of hiking) for over 15 years. It&amp;rsquo;s the damnedest thing, all I want to do now is work my butt off in the gym. The addiction gene has struck again. And again the results have been positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find what you love and let it kill you. - Charles Bukowski&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well killing me is a little extreme. I often wonder how these good addictions come to me. Did I seek them out or have I just been lucky?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What my guitar taught me</title>
      <link>http://clintsimon.com/blog/2011/2011-02-27-What-my-guitar-taught-me/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It turns out that my guitar taught me a valuable lesson. Somehow in this crazy house that I live in, ago a week ago, my guitar spontaneously migrated out of my office. One of the kids moved it to the upstairs bonus room without my knowledge. I usually keep my acoustic guitar right next to my work desk. It sits there 99 percent of the time. Occasionally when the mode strikes, I pick it up and strum a tune. Maybe an old song I like or a totally random conglomeration of melodies that I have long forgotten. It&amp;rsquo;s a little escape for me when my mind is consumed by heavier things It&amp;rsquo;s always there for the taking at a moments notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not any more. An interesting thing happened over the next week. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of playing. Not even once. Nada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That got me thinking about immediacy and the modern world that we live in. We are constantly engaged with TV, movies, iPad, iPhone, DVR, Netflix, Facebook, twitter, foursquare, text messages,and on it goes. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this is our primitive prey behavior coming to the limelight or if it&amp;rsquo;s our technology fascination or some combination of both. Have you ever seen a cow sleep with its eyes open? That&amp;rsquo;s because they are a prey animal and it&amp;rsquo;s not a good thing to forget about your surroundings when you are on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing, just a few years ago I was just the opposite. Intently focused for hours on end. I remember on one occasion I totally ignored a colleague who was talking to me in at my desk because I was go engrossed in my work. I&amp;rsquo;m not proud of that one. So what happened to me? At some point I started to change. My brain went from a calm river slowly but surely chugging along to a sprinkler flailing in all direction at once. It seems each of these states has some value depending on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guitar taunt me that immediacy is king.&lt;/p&gt;
