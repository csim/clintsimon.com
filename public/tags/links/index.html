<blockquote>
<p>When I first started ignoring news, I felt that I was simply making an excuse, that if I had more time I should read the news. Today, however, it is a very deliberate choice and I feel consistently happier every single day due to ignoring the mainstream news. It just so happens that the last 2 years have also been the most enjoyable and productive of my entire life, and have contained some of my greatest achievements. Here are a few reasons I think we should stop consuming mainstream news:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting article, I wish I could say that I follow this advice. I think it&rsquo;s important to know the details that matter most in your life and filter out the noise. Most of the news is noise. I can&rsquo;t stand 24-hour news channels.</p>

<p>Interesting that this is debatable. In this day and age, we have high level languages that are not only approachable but down right easy. Anyone can learn to be a programmer but only a small percentage can be passionate enough about it to carve out a career. The single biggest factor is how bad you want it.</p>

<p>Another article bashing Windows 8 and the Microsoft strategy around it. It seems that because of Apple&rsquo;s success, Microsoft is in a no-win situation according to the pundits.</p>

<p>Personally I quite like Windows 8 and I think it will most certainly have an impact. There is no doubt that Microsoft is behind the innovation curve, but Windows 8 is a step in the right direction. Time will tell if Microsoft can capture the rapidly merging business and consumer IT space. First and foremost Windows 8 needs apps, and lots of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we are seeing is Microsoft power brokers asleep at the helm, specifically their evangelism is dead and lastly their messaging around the transition for Silverlight/WPF has been fumbled to the point where its easy now to believe Microsoft has hit &ldquo;Shift+Delete&rdquo; on these two products than it is to read the above (to much carnage on the roadmap now).</p>

<p>If Microsoft had of come out and said something to the effect - &ldquo;Look you asked us to fix WPF and Silverlight. We did that, we came up with a way now that lets you develop for our platform in three ways. The first is C++ if you want deeper access to Windows then we&rsquo;ve tided up our Com++ API&rsquo;s to a way that C# developers have found palatable. If you don&rsquo;t want to do native code then you can build applications like you have done with SilverLight in the past but the difference is it will now only be Windows only (sorry). If you then want to build apps that are cross-platform then again we&rsquo;ve got HTML5 and Internet Explorer story brewing whilst its important to understand that we will not be looking to expand our developer story beyond Windows anymore (there is a certain amount of control HTML5 will give but we still believe Internet Explorer is a better bet overall).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting rundown delivered from a Windows 8 platform insider.</p>

<h3 id="windows-8-is-not-good-for-gamers-http-kotaku-com-5936535-windows-8-is-not-good-for-gamers:34b51d5b1b1fdd67f0f8437be25000c9"><a href="http://kotaku.com/5936535/windows-8-is-not-good-for-gamers">Windows 8 Is Not Good For Gamers</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly that Windows 8 doesn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s fast and, from my still-limited experience, stable. Programs, once open, run well. The major issues are twofold: first, Microsoft has inserted several extra steps into the process of performing basic functions like &ldquo;launching a program&rdquo; or &ldquo;shutting down the system.&rdquo; Second, the parallel tracks of the &ldquo;Metro&rdquo; and Desktop environments give it what feels like a split personality. The overall result makes it challenging to navigate smoothly, and will likely frustrate many gamers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frank recap and opinion. It is obvious that software and hardware is becoming more specialized and traditional outlets (PCs and phones) are more squarely focused on casual gaming.</p>

<p>Valve is correctly recognizing this and guiding their business accordingly. This is not the fault of Windows 8 but an industry trend. I just don&rsquo;t see the conflict with Windows 8 directly.</p>

<p>Great overview of the EF5 release with summary and coding samples.</p>

<p>Jason Zander:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New features in Entity Framework 5:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enum support is a long awaited feature for EF and allows you to have enum properties in your domain classes. EF5 makes enum support available in the EF Designer and Code First.</li>
<li>Table-valued functions in an existing database can now be included in models that are created using the EF Designer.</li>
<li>Spatial data types can now be exposed in your model using the DbGeography and DbGeometry types. Spatial data can be included in models created with the EF Designer or Code First.</li>
<li>EF5 also includes some significant performance improvements which you can find out more about on the ADO.NET Blog.</li>
</ul>

<p>The EF Designer, which is included in Visual Studio 2012, also has some new features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Models can now be split up into multiple diagrams, which is great for working with larger models. You can also apply coloring to entities to help identify subsections of your model.</p></li>

<li><p>Improvements to the wizard that reverse engineers a model from a database make it easier and quicker to batch import stored procedures for querying data.</p></li>

<p>Direct2D is a 2D graphics API that is built on top of Direct3D, enabling it to take advantage of the powerful GPU hardware that is now a feature of every PC. It allows programmers to deal with 2D concepts-lines, rectangles, ellipses-and converts them behind the scenes into the fundamental 3D objects, points, lines, and triangles, so that the GPU can draw them.</p>

<p>John Biggs for TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft had many wins. The Xbox is a notable success and Windows 8 could lead to a sea change in user interface and user experience. However, given the steady stream of duds popped out by MS over the past few years - Zune, C#, Vista, and the Kin phone family (not to mention their insistent failure to capitalize on touch or web infrastructure servers) - it&rsquo;s not hard to see why the bloom is off the Microsoft rose. The company is huge - 94,290 according to the official ledger - and as Kurt Eichenwald notes in Vanity Fair, the company&rsquo;s strange bell curve ranking system has frustrated their best and brightest engineers. Freshly minted MBAs and CS majors have been shown, time and time again, that there is no value in going after Microsoft millions when Google and the rest of Silicon Valley is right down the coast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Serious bile from Techcrunch (and vanity fair). They seem to completely overlook the enterprise software market (where Microsoft dominates) to focus on consumer and startup technologies. Fair enough that Microsoft struggles in these areas, but at least paint a complete picture.</p>

<p>By the way, C# is ranked <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">5th in the Tiobe programming index</a>. Failure, eh?</p>
