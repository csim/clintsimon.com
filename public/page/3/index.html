    <p>Bit of a rant here. I received this message today Microsoft.</p>

<div class="vinette"><img src=

"{{ site.url }}/images/ms_win8_dev_marketing.png" /></div>

<p>Do you think the average developer knows that &ldquo;Windows 8 GA&rdquo; means?</p>

<p>GA stands for &ldquo;Generally Availability&rdquo;. Put yourself in the position of the Microsoft marketer who composed this message. Why on Earth won&rsquo;t you just write out the words instead of using the abbreviation?</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t need to be a secret handshake. Granted, if you <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video/5072264/googling-with-bing">Google it on bing</a>, you&rsquo;ll get an answer fairly quickly. But really?!? Do we need to be put through this?</p>

<p>Microsoft &ndash; just type it out next time.</p>

<p>I got my hands on a copy of Windows 8 through <a href="http://msdn.com">MSDN</a> about a month ago and installed it immediately. I&rsquo;ve used it since then as my daily working machine on my main laptop.</p>

<p>First of all the speed of Windows 8 is apparent from the start. Everything feels faster - boot time, application launch, etc. I am working on a 3 year old Lenovo W500 and I can honestly say that Windows 8 has extended its life by at least 6 months. It was fast enough under Win7 but with Win8, it seems to have legs.</p>

<p>Coming into this experiment, I had my doubts. As a developer, how would I fair in the land of the Metro UI and deprioritize desktop?</p>

<h3 id="the-start-screen:6fa5ce79b6dcd2d1ab38561ddccaf0fe">The Start Screen</h3>

<p>The start menu is full-screen now and it has some animation built into it. It did take me a little while to get used to it but really this is just a new UI on top of the same start menu that we are all used to. As a developer I stay mostly in the desktop but the metro start screen is a necessary evil once in a while.</p>

<div class="vinette"><img src=

"{{ site.url }}/images/start_screen.png" /></div>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit it took me a few days to get used to it. My advice is to embrace this right away and enjoy it for what it is - some UI sugar that plays nicely with tablets. It still works well with mouse and keyboard. You can still search for applications or settings by simply typing and you can still pin your most used applications. Once there are more useful metro apps, the start screen will be much more useful.</p>

<p>I found that pinning my most used applications to the desktop task bar almost entirely eliminates the need to open the start screen at all. As a developer this is exactly what I want, just get out of my way. If you just can&rsquo;t live without the Windows 7 start menu, take a look at <a href="http://lee-soft.com/vistart/">ViStart</a>.</p>

<h3 id="everyday-tasks:6fa5ce79b6dcd2d1ab38561ddccaf0fe">Everyday Tasks</h3>

<p>I mostly stay in the desktop. In fact, I would say that at least 90% of my time is spent there. The first thing you should do is pin everything that you use to the taskbar. This will help you avoid the start screen. Mind you, there is nothing wrong with the start screen but you probably don&rsquo;t want to go there too often.</p>

<p>The desktop is mostly unchanged from Windows 7, with just a few exceptions. First the glass aero desktop is gone, no more see-through window chrome. It has been sacrificed in the name of battery life.</p>

<p>Secondly, the task manager has been completely rebuilt and redesigned. This thing is awesome. A quantum leap upgrade. You can now see disk usage, app history, startup cost for apps and services. Remember all those time you thought &ldquo;What the hell is going on with my machine?&rdquo;. Well, now you can answer that question.</p>

<div class="vinette"><img src=

"{{ site.url }}/images/task_manager.png" /></div>

<h3 id="metro-apps:6fa5ce79b6dcd2d1ab38561ddccaf0fe">Metro Apps</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, metro apps have not arrived yet. I have no doubt that they will when Windows 8 goes mainstream after the global launch on October 25th. I can see the utility, even on a desktop, but for now it&rsquo;s just promises.</p>

<p>The UI looks descent on a desktop and even usable, but metro will only shine when tablets and touch are in the mainstream. Microsoft&rsquo;s bet here is palpable. Interface unification of Xbox, Windows Desktop and Windows Phone is the holy grail for which Microsoft is betting the company. As everyone has said for years, it has a lot of promise.</p>

<p>If you are a developer and don&rsquo;t care for Metro, don&rsquo;t use it. The only time you&rsquo;ll need it is when you press the windows key and if you configure your machine correctly, you won&rsquo;t be hitting the windows key very often.</p>

<h3 id="user-interface:6fa5ce79b6dcd2d1ab38561ddccaf0fe">User Interface</h3>

<p>Numerous small UI enhancement have been incorporated into Windows 8. There are too many to list and it&rsquo;s better if you find them yourself. I am still finding new tidbits almost daily. Little flourishes which add flavor to the experience</p>

<p>The file copy dialog is a thing of beauty. Notice the transfer graph over time and the spark line for the current transfer speed. Very cool. You can also pause the file copy which is really convenient when you need to go offline temporarily.</p>

<div class="vinette"><img src=

"{{ site.url }}/images/file_copy_dialog.png" /></div>

<p>Windows 8 is noticeable faster in almost all aspects. Boot times are particularly impressive. I have seen at least a 50% increase in startup speed. Everything is snappy - changing windows, opening applications</p>

<h3 id="shortcut-keys:6fa5ce79b6dcd2d1ab38561ddccaf0fe">Shortcut Keys</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a few shortcut keys that I have found to be invaluable.</p>

<p>Most useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Windows + X</strong>
Opens an administration context menu in the bottom left corner of the screen. This is indispensable for power users, it lets you jump to a bunch of useful tools.</li>
<li><strong>Windows + C</strong>
Opens the charm menu at the right edge of the screen. You don&rsquo;t have to point the most at the upper right corner.</li>
</ul>

<p>Others:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Windows + Q</strong> - Show all apps</li>
<li><strong>Windows + W</strong>  - Search settings</li>
<li><strong>Windows + R</strong> - Run a command</li>
<li><strong>Windows + I</strong> - Settings slide out</li>
<li><strong>Windows + P</strong> - Monitor configuration (extend, duplicate)</li>
<li><strong>Windows + L</strong> - Lock session</li>
<li><strong>Windows + K</strong> - Devices slide out</li>
<li><strong>Windows + H</strong> - Share slide out</li>
<li><strong>Windows + F</strong> - Search Files</li>
<li><strong>Windows + D</strong> - Show the desktop</li>
<li><strong>Windows + .</strong> - Toggle through snapping</li>
<li><strong>Windows + E</strong> - Opens file explorer</li>
<li><strong>Windows + ,</strong> - Desktop peek</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion:6fa5ce79b6dcd2d1ab38561ddccaf0fe">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I can honestly say that I would not go back to Windows 7. Win8 feels like a winner. Good performance and it gets out of my way. It has a solid future as a touch screen operating system to boot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first started ignoring news, I felt that I was simply making an excuse, that if I had more time I should read the news. Today, however, it is a very deliberate choice and I feel consistently happier every single day due to ignoring the mainstream news. It just so happens that the last 2 years have also been the most enjoyable and productive of my entire life, and have contained some of my greatest achievements. Here are a few reasons I think we should stop consuming mainstream news:</p>

<p>Interesting article, I wish I could say that I follow this advice. I think it&rsquo;s important to know the details that matter most in your life and filter out the noise. Most of the news is noise. I can&rsquo;t stand 24-hour news channels.</p>

<p>Interesting that this is debatable. In this day and age, we have high level languages that are not only approachable but down right easy. Anyone can learn to be a programmer but only a small percentage can be passionate enough about it to carve out a career. The single biggest factor is how bad you want it.</p>

<p>Another article bashing Windows 8 and the Microsoft strategy around it. It seems that because of Apple&rsquo;s success, Microsoft is in a no-win situation according to the pundits.</p>

<p>Personally I quite like Windows 8 and I think it will most certainly have an impact. There is no doubt that Microsoft is behind the innovation curve, but Windows 8 is a step in the right direction. Time will tell if Microsoft can capture the rapidly merging business and consumer IT space. First and foremost Windows 8 needs apps, and lots of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we are seeing is Microsoft power brokers asleep at the helm, specifically their evangelism is dead and lastly their messaging around the transition for Silverlight/WPF has been fumbled to the point where its easy now to believe Microsoft has hit &ldquo;Shift+Delete&rdquo; on these two products than it is to read the above (to much carnage on the roadmap now).</p>

<p>If Microsoft had of come out and said something to the effect - &ldquo;Look you asked us to fix WPF and Silverlight. We did that, we came up with a way now that lets you develop for our platform in three ways. The first is C++ if you want deeper access to Windows then we&rsquo;ve tided up our Com++ API&rsquo;s to a way that C# developers have found palatable. If you don&rsquo;t want to do native code then you can build applications like you have done with SilverLight in the past but the difference is it will now only be Windows only (sorry). If you then want to build apps that are cross-platform then again we&rsquo;ve got HTML5 and Internet Explorer story brewing whilst its important to understand that we will not be looking to expand our developer story beyond Windows anymore (there is a certain amount of control HTML5 will give but we still believe Internet Explorer is a better bet overall).</p>

<p>Interesting rundown delivered from a Windows 8 platform insider.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly that Windows 8 doesn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s fast and, from my still-limited experience, stable. Programs, once open, run well. The major issues are twofold: first, Microsoft has inserted several extra steps into the process of performing basic functions like &ldquo;launching a program&rdquo; or &ldquo;shutting down the system.&rdquo; Second, the parallel tracks of the &ldquo;Metro&rdquo; and Desktop environments give it what feels like a split personality. The overall result makes it challenging to navigate smoothly, and will likely frustrate many gamers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frank recap and opinion. It is obvious that software and hardware is becoming more specialized and traditional outlets (PCs and phones) are more squarely focused on casual gaming.</p>

<p>Valve is correctly recognizing this and guiding their business accordingly. This is not the fault of Windows 8 but an industry trend. I just don&rsquo;t see the conflict with Windows 8 directly.</p>

<p>John Biggs for TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft had many wins. The Xbox is a notable success and Windows 8 could lead to a sea change in user interface and user experience. However, given the steady stream of duds popped out by MS over the past few years - Zune, C#, Vista, and the Kin phone family (not to mention their insistent failure to capitalize on touch or web infrastructure servers) - it&rsquo;s not hard to see why the bloom is off the Microsoft rose. The company is huge - 94,290 according to the official ledger - and as Kurt Eichenwald notes in Vanity Fair, the company&rsquo;s strange bell curve ranking system has frustrated their best and brightest engineers. Freshly minted MBAs and CS majors have been shown, time and time again, that there is no value in going after Microsoft millions when Google and the rest of Silicon Valley is right down the coast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Serious bile from Techcrunch (and vanity fair). They seem to completely overlook the enterprise software market (where Microsoft dominates) to focus on consumer and startup technologies. Fair enough that Microsoft struggles in these areas, but at least paint a complete picture.</p>

<p>By the way, C# is ranked <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">5th in the Tiobe programming index</a>. Failure, eh?</p>

    <p>Whether you know it or not, you are training everyone you interact with each day. When you answer that email at midnight or take that call at 8PM, you are sending a message. The message is that you work any time and you are willing to sacrifice your personal life for the job.</p>

<p>In typical over-achiever fashion, you are reacting to each request without regard for your personal well-being. After following this pattern for years, I have realized that I need to stop the vicious cycle.</p>

<div class="vinette"><img src=

"{{ site.url }}/images/vicious-cycle-Zzbbc.jpg" />you can't win</div>

<p>Here are a few things that I have learned:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Prioritize and focus</strong>. Understand the actions that are most beneficial to your career advancement. Many times I have found myself chasing the shiny object without understanding why.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Say no gracefully.</strong> When enough is enough, just politely say no. Set your boundaries. Be reasonable but firm, anyone worth their salt will respect your boundaries.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ignore when possible.</strong> There are times when saying nothing is the best thing to do. Add value where you can but don&rsquo;t drive down a path that you cannot sustain. Under promise and over deliver.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To be clear, I am not advocating begin lazy or apathetic. Quite the opposite, I am saying that with the right priorities you can focus doubly on what matter to achieve twice the effect.</p>

    <p>I ran into an interesting problem with Google app engine. It seems that the memcache time limit is enforced differently on the development server versus the production servers.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/FAQ#What_are_the_limits_on_setting_expire_time?_(why_is_there_a_30_d">The documentation</a> says that the time limit for a memcache key is 30 days. The behavior that I have observed is that if you set a memcache key to timeout at 30 days, the development server (on windows) will happily persist the data as expected.</p>

<p>On the production servers, it seems that the behavior is much different. I have notice with a timeout of 30 days, that memcache will not only ignore the persisted key but it will also cause erratic behavior for instances in your application.</p>

<p>Under these conditions a new instance of my application was start for each request! Obviously this adversely effects performance.</p>

<p>Once I changed the memcache timeout to a lesser value (under 30 days), the problem stopped.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I have seen many developers struggle with a growing dilemma, do I devote my time to platform development?</p>

<p>When I say &ldquo;platform development&rdquo; I mean building application on products such as <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">Microsoft SharePoint</a> and <a href="http://crm.dynamics.com/online/default.aspx?tabid=fits-your-business&amp;fbid=gnPbjZqF5wO">Microsoft CRM</a>. The IT world is rapidly moving toward standardizing on platforms such as these. They offer lower IT costs, standardized infrastructure and overall lower cost of ownership. It makes sense from a business perspective, but what do you do as a developer?</p>

<p>The problem here is that we have all been devoting all of our time to becoming better coders, designing systems and generally attacking every problem from the ground up. Not so in the platform world. You begin with a packaged software product, then extend it to meet a customers needs. These extensions can be simply point and click configurations, embedded code such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, or compiled code which changes behavior in the product.</p>

<p>In the new world of platforms, we are asked to live in a box. That box is called a platform. They bring limitations, boundaries and a sense that we can&rsquo;t use all the tools that we have worked so hard to learn and build over the years.</p>

<p>Most of my experience is with <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">Microsoft SharePoint</a> and <a href="http://crm.dynamics.com/online/default.aspx?tabid=fits-your-business&amp;fbid=gnPbjZqF5wO">Microsoft CRM</a> but the trend is industry-wide. IT shops have been burned by custom software and they want some predictability over time. I get it.</p>

<p>Customers generally expect the platform to host a wide range of applications and act as a clearing house for all future development activities. The problem comes in when requirements don&rsquo;t match up to the platforms capabilities. This can be a scale issue, or a mismatch of the smallest detail. These gaps are extremely painful for developers because the client is expecting the fully baked solution, but the platform doesn&rsquo;t entirely deliver. It&rsquo;s up to us to build that last 10% of the solution, which takes 50% of the effort. Blarg!</p>

<p>In other scenarios, the product (particularly <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">SharePoint</a>) is a really &ldquo;big hammer&rdquo; that solves lots of problems and you have no choice but to use the entire platform. For instance, say a client wants Content Management. Well, <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">SharePoint</a> certainly does that, but it also comes with collaboration, profiling, personalization, single sign-on, search, etc. Sometimes it can feel like you boiling the ocean for a cup of tea.</p>

<p>I have struggled to reconcile these issues and come to the conclusion that there are really two options for developers.</p>

<h3 id="first-option:5270f738531673956d3b5b927c5892fc">First Option</h3>

<p>Swallow your pride and start learning a platform. There are a ton of opportunities right now for platform work, that work is not going to end any time soon and you might as well take the plunge sooner than later. There will be some limitations but in return you will get some opportunities that were not possible before.</p>

<p>Usually enterprises have a portfolio of systems, and your project is just one of them. In the platform world you will need to integrate with other systems in a more reliable and sensible way. Sometimes this integration work is custom (cha-ching!) other times it is not. But the point is that the platform allows you to think at a higher level without being mired in minutia of coding all the components yourself. The upside is that you can use you brain cycles to think about solving bigger problems and delivering more value.</p>

<h3 id="second-option:5270f738531673956d3b5b927c5892fc">Second Option</h3>

<p>Punt. Find a product company you want to work for, or a start-up that seems interesting. If you are in consulting there is a majority chance that you will be moved in to a platform role. If that&rsquo;s not where you want to be, get out immediately.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen too many people struggle through the transition. Always battling to get the custom application development work on any project and generally hating life. Don&rsquo;t get swept away in the idealized vision that you can buck the trend. See this transition for what it is to you, either a way to move in a new direction or get out before you cause yourself a lot of heartache.</p>

<p>There are a million and one ways to backup files from your hard drive. For me, the most important things are making sure that the files that cannot be replaced are safe.</p>

<p>Rather than opt for a relatively complicated system image based backup system such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx">Windows Home Server</a> or a automated file copy utility such <a href="https://www.sugarsync.com/">SugarSync</a>, I instead prefer good old fashioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy">Robocopy</a> and physical DVD media. This might sound archaic in the age of cloud computing but I have found it to be the best way to ensure that I will not lose the most important files and have the least amount of headaches.</p>

<h3 id="my-setup:11f6dbaeda945b330401dc8c51a0a477">My setup</h3>

<p>I have a portable 1TB drive which holds all of my media and working files. This includes family pictures, videos and virtual machines. I also have a non-portable 1TB drive that I use for only backups.</p>

<p>For everyday files like word docs, excel spreadsheets, etc. I use <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. These files are important enough that I want then accessible anywhere, anytime but they are not important enough to warrant a physical copy on DVD. <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> is great for this purpose, but it&rsquo;s a big pricey when you go above the 2GB free limit. It runs $99 for 50GB/year and $199 for 100GB/year.</p>

<h3 id="my-strategy:11f6dbaeda945b330401dc8c51a0a477">My strategy</h3>

<p>Once a week I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy">Robocopy</a> to backup all important files from my laptop and the portable drive to the backup drive. When a backup is done, all important files are duplicated to the desktop drive. This covers the potential case where my portable drive is either lost or stolen.</p>

<p>Once a month I copy all the very important files to physical DVD discs. These include family photos and videos. I use <a href="http://hcidesign.com/dvdspan/">DVDSpan</a> to burn a set of folders a set of DVD discs. This utility is rather old but it is very useful and has worked fantastically for me. It takes a folder or set of folders and writes them across a set of DVD discs. Granted this won&rsquo;t work if you have hundreds of Gigabytes to backup.</p>

<p>In my case I am only looking to backup around 50GB of media files. To make things even easier the media files don&rsquo;t change over time. once a file is archive, it does not need to be archived again.</p>

<p>Then writing files using <a href="http://hcidesign.com/dvdspan/">DVDSpan</a>, it helps to have the files organized into date folders. For example /Photos/2011/2011-01. This way when it&rsquo;s time to write DVDs, I can simply burn the recent files that have not been archived and ignore the files that I have already archived.</p>

<p>The new discs get sent to the safe-deposit box for safe keeping. I have researched various methods of storing files off site such as <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> or <a href="http://www.keepvault.com/">KeepVault</a>. So far nothing beats driving down to the safe deposit box at the local bank. I have around 60GB of Gigabytes of photos and videos, but the net new data is less than 10GB per month. That means that I can get away with burning roughly 2 DVD discs for each month.</p>

<p>As cloud backup system mature, I may change my approach but for now I&rsquo;m staying old school.</p>
