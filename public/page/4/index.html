<p>Over the past few years I have seen many developers struggle with a growing dilemma, do I devote my time to platform development?</p>

<p>When I say &ldquo;platform development&rdquo; I mean building application on products such as <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">Microsoft SharePoint</a> and <a href="http://crm.dynamics.com/online/default.aspx?tabid=fits-your-business&amp;fbid=gnPbjZqF5wO">Microsoft CRM</a>. The IT world is rapidly moving toward standardizing on platforms such as these. They offer lower IT costs, standardized infrastructure and overall lower cost of ownership. It makes sense from a business perspective, but what do you do as a developer?</p>

<p>The problem here is that we have all been devoting all of our time to becoming better coders, designing systems and generally attacking every problem from the ground up. Not so in the platform world. You begin with a packaged software product, then extend it to meet a customers needs. These extensions can be simply point and click configurations, embedded code such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, or compiled code which changes behavior in the product.</p>

<p>In the new world of platforms, we are asked to live in a box. That box is called a platform. They bring limitations, boundaries and a sense that we can&rsquo;t use all the tools that we have worked so hard to learn and build over the years.</p>

<p>Most of my experience is with <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">Microsoft SharePoint</a> and <a href="http://crm.dynamics.com/online/default.aspx?tabid=fits-your-business&amp;fbid=gnPbjZqF5wO">Microsoft CRM</a> but the trend is industry-wide. IT shops have been burned by custom software and they want some predictability over time. I get it.</p>

<p>Customers generally expect the platform to host a wide range of applications and act as a clearing house for all future development activities. The problem comes in when requirements don&rsquo;t match up to the platforms capabilities. This can be a scale issue, or a mismatch of the smallest detail. These gaps are extremely painful for developers because the client is expecting the fully baked solution, but the platform doesn&rsquo;t entirely deliver. It&rsquo;s up to us to build that last 10% of the solution, which takes 50% of the effort. Blarg!</p>

<p>In other scenarios, the product (particularly <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">SharePoint</a>) is a really &ldquo;big hammer&rdquo; that solves lots of problems and you have no choice but to use the entire platform. For instance, say a client wants Content Management. Well, <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">SharePoint</a> certainly does that, but it also comes with collaboration, profiling, personalization, single sign-on, search, etc. Sometimes it can feel like you boiling the ocean for a cup of tea.</p>

<p>I have struggled to reconcile these issues and come to the conclusion that there are really two options for developers.</p>

<h3 id="first-option:5270f738531673956d3b5b927c5892fc">First Option</h3>

<p>Swallow your pride and start learning a platform. There are a ton of opportunities right now for platform work, that work is not going to end any time soon and you might as well take the plunge sooner than later. There will be some limitations but in return you will get some opportunities that were not possible before.</p>

<p>Usually enterprises have a portfolio of systems, and your project is just one of them. In the platform world you will need to integrate with other systems in a more reliable and sensible way. Sometimes this integration work is custom (cha-ching!) other times it is not. But the point is that the platform allows you to think at a higher level without being mired in minutia of coding all the components yourself. The upside is that you can use you brain cycles to think about solving bigger problems and delivering more value.</p>

<h3 id="second-option:5270f738531673956d3b5b927c5892fc">Second Option</h3>

<p>Punt. Find a product company you want to work for, or a start-up that seems interesting. If you are in consulting there is a majority chance that you will be moved in to a platform role. If that&rsquo;s not where you want to be, get out immediately.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen too many people struggle through the transition. Always battling to get the custom application development work on any project and generally hating life. Don&rsquo;t get swept away in the idealized vision that you can buck the trend. See this transition for what it is to you, either a way to move in a new direction or get out before you cause yourself a lot of heartache.</p>

<p>There are a million and one ways to backup files from your hard drive. For me, the most important things are making sure that the files that cannot be replaced are safe.</p>

<p>Rather than opt for a relatively complicated system image based backup system such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx">Windows Home Server</a> or a automated file copy utility such <a href="https://www.sugarsync.com/">SugarSync</a>, I instead prefer good old fashioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy">Robocopy</a> and physical DVD media. This might sound archaic in the age of cloud computing but I have found it to be the best way to ensure that I will not lose the most important files and have the least amount of headaches.</p>

<h3 id="my-setup:11f6dbaeda945b330401dc8c51a0a477">My setup</h3>

<p>I have a portable 1TB drive which holds all of my media and working files. This includes family pictures, videos and virtual machines. I also have a non-portable 1TB drive that I use for only backups.</p>

<p>For everyday files like word docs, excel spreadsheets, etc. I use <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. These files are important enough that I want then accessible anywhere, anytime but they are not important enough to warrant a physical copy on DVD. <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> is great for this purpose, but it&rsquo;s a big pricey when you go above the 2GB free limit. It runs $99 for 50GB/year and $199 for 100GB/year.</p>

<h3 id="my-strategy:11f6dbaeda945b330401dc8c51a0a477">My strategy</h3>

<p>Once a week I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy">Robocopy</a> to backup all important files from my laptop and the portable drive to the backup drive. When a backup is done, all important files are duplicated to the desktop drive. This covers the potential case where my portable drive is either lost or stolen.</p>

<p>Once a month I copy all the very important files to physical DVD discs. These include family photos and videos. I use <a href="http://hcidesign.com/dvdspan/">DVDSpan</a> to burn a set of folders a set of DVD discs. This utility is rather old but it is very useful and has worked fantastically for me. It takes a folder or set of folders and writes them across a set of DVD discs. Granted this won&rsquo;t work if you have hundreds of Gigabytes to backup.</p>

<p>In my case I am only looking to backup around 50GB of media files. To make things even easier the media files don&rsquo;t change over time. once a file is archive, it does not need to be archived again.</p>

<p>Then writing files using <a href="http://hcidesign.com/dvdspan/">DVDSpan</a>, it helps to have the files organized into date folders. For example /Photos/2011/2011-01. This way when it&rsquo;s time to write DVDs, I can simply burn the recent files that have not been archived and ignore the files that I have already archived.</p>

<p>The new discs get sent to the safe-deposit box for safe keeping. I have researched various methods of storing files off site such as <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> or <a href="http://www.keepvault.com/">KeepVault</a>. So far nothing beats driving down to the safe deposit box at the local bank. I have around 60GB of Gigabytes of photos and videos, but the net new data is less than 10GB per month. That means that I can get away with burning roughly 2 DVD discs for each month.</p>

<p>As cloud backup system mature, I may change my approach but for now I&rsquo;m staying old school.</p>

    <p>Google&rsquo;s chrome browser is quickly gaining momentum and market share. Recently it has even been projected the before the end of 2011 chrome will surpass firefox as the second most used browser, behind Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think is great about Google Chrome:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It gets out of your way</strong>. As the name indicates, the browser is not in your way at all. The content is front and center and the browser is an afterthought.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent JavaScript performance</strong>. JavaScript has become the way all web applications are written. <em>In practice</em>, chrome has the best JavaScript performance that I have seen. It blows away Internet explorer, event IE9 (although IE9 has come a long way).</li>
<li><strong>The release schedule rocks.</strong> Major versions are released every 6 months and the upgrade process is completely seamless. Chrome is already on version 14. Granted the major releases are not as major as a new IE release, but it is clear that Google is committed to an aggressive release schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Great development tools</strong>. The developer tools in Chrome are second only to <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>. That&rsquo;s saying a lot, firebug is incredible but Chrome is a close second. In some ways I like Chrome better, especially the DOM explorer.</li>
<li><strong>Sync everything</strong>. All browser settings, bookmarks and passwords can be stored in the Google cloud. If you roam across machines or rebuild your machines often, this is a big time saver.</li>
<li><strong>HTML5 and CSS3 support</strong>. Support for new technologies is great in Chrome, thanks in part to the fact that it is built on top of the popular open source <a href="http://www.webkit.org/">WebKit</a> framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is interesting in a lot of ways. First, Google is not generally thought of as a desktop software company. This is changing and Chrome is a part of that.</p>

<p>For Google, Chrome is strategic in that it gives Google some control (and consistency) over how their services are presented on the desktop. Google is a web software company and Chrome is an attempt at controlling the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile">last mile</a>&rdquo; problem. This is important as it gives Google a foot hold on the desktop and a fighting chance against Microsoft.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/chromebook/">Chromebooks</a> are also an interesting concept. A computer that is basically just a browser, in a lightweight package. Chrome is obviously a huge part of these machines and Google is banking on the fact that Chrome can become an everyday part of your web experience.</p>

    <p>I thought it would be nice to see my last tweet on my blog. It turns out that there is an easy way to do this using jquery and the twitter api. These instructions may not work for you if your blogging platform does not allow embedded JavaScript (wordpress.com does not).</p>

<p>To get the tweets for any user in JSON format you can visit <a href="http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline/username.json?callback=?">http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline/username.json?callback=?</a></p>

<p>Where username is the twitter username.</p>

<p>Make sure that you first have jquery included in your page like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=jquery.html"></script>

<p>Then add this script to pull the last tweet for a username:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=pulltweet.html"></script>

<p>Replace techhike with the twitter username that you are interested in.</p>

<p>Next add this markup to your page:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=div.html"></script>

<p>This will act as a container for your last tweet.</p>

<p>As an added bonus I decided to write a little javascript to convert URLs in the tweet to hyperlinks. This mimics the behavior on twitter.com. Also, I added a function that creates hyperlinks for twitter handles such as (@TechHike). This link points to the appropriate profile on twitter.com.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=helpers.html"></script>

<p>The final javascript looks like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/csim/10285505.js?file=load.html"></script>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Google App engine is in the process of changing it&rsquo;s pricing model. At present this new pricing model goes into effect on December 1, 2011. There has been quite an uproar among App engine developers. In some cases the new billing model raises monthly costs by more than 300%. This has cause quite a reaction among the community and the backlash is very real</p>

<h3 id="what-is-changing:9829541407e1bc2b452f513247e9d720">What is changing?</h3>

<p>The primary change is that Google is moving from a model where you are charged by CPU time to a model where you are charged by &ldquo;instance time&rdquo;. This means that google charges are not necessarily based on pure CPU use but rather on the amount of instances of your application the Google scheduler decides to run. To magnify matters, most web applications are IO bound and the current version of Python supported by App Engine is single threaded.</p>

<p>That means that your application is probably using more instances that you think. Because one instance can only handle a fixed amount of traffic based on IO and threading, the scheduler is forced to create instances more often for Python applications. All of these circumstances add up to a much higher cost for developers.</p>

<p>Google has added sliders that allow you to tweak the scheduler behavior. You can now change the maximum number of idle instances and the minimum pending wait time. This allow us to dictate how long is a acceptable waiting time per request and how many instances show be available for traffic spikes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m personally glad these are available, although others disagree. I have found them to be helpful for my small(ish) application because latency is not a concern, so I can set the min latency up to around 700ms. This means that requests can wait to be served from an <em>existing</em> instance. Basically all output from my application is cached, so my request processing time is under 100ms. Setting the min pending latency to 700ms basically means that my application can remain free. I like free.</p>

<p>It appears as though CPU billing was a bad idea in the first place and Google is now correcting for this by changing to instance based billing. In the end, Google needs to pay for the physical resources an application uses and as it turns out web applications use very little CPU as compared to IO with the datastore or other APIs.</p>

<p>So, is the dream of a true &ldquo;Platform as a Service&rdquo; dead? Yes and No. The precise billing aspect of PaaS is dead at Google for the moment, but App Engine (and PaaS for that matter) is not defined by this shortcoming. Ultimately Google has recognized that having an instance running costs money even if the CPU usage for that instance is zero. Said another way, memory costs money. An instance will always consume memory if it is running. And not only will it consume memory but Google will need to reserve all the memory that it <em>may</em> need. This is a reality of physics.</p>

<p>I think we have become a little spoiled in that we have come to expect that computing will always become cheaper over time. I wonder how much it would cost to build your own ultra scalable, redundant, highly replicated system?</p>

<h3 id="optimization:9829541407e1bc2b452f513247e9d720">Optimization</h3>

<p>In the new world of App Engine where instances are charged, the emphasis is now on eliminating IO bound activities. That means eliminate datastore calls, URL fetch call, etc. If you have instances that are waiting around for IO activities to complete, then you are running to many instances.</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t pull more data than you need for the data store. Use &ldquo;Select <em>key</em>&rdquo; where possible. Limit your fetches to the smallest possible row sets.</li>
<li>Cache results when ever possible. If you are displaying the same data, then cache it per page, per user or per application.</li>
<li>Use a Task Queue. Can this operation run in the background? Task queues can eliminate instances by way of pushing work for a dedicated backend.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-good-news:9829541407e1bc2b452f513247e9d720">The good news&hellip;</h3>

<p>App Engine was not decommissioned. I know this sounds like little consolation, but many Google projects have been scrapped over the past 6 months and App Engine is not one of them. This shows that Google is willing to make difficult decisions when it comes to App Engine and that they are committed to having a PaaS offering for the long term.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that Google has a right to at least break even on App Engine. The service is incredible, the free tier still exists and the new <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/sla.html">SLA terms</a> are top notch. App Engine is still a worth competitor in the PaaS market, even with the new pricing.</p>

    <p>Over the years I have come across software consulting companies in various states. It occurs to me that there must be a finite set of categories that defines the culture of a consultancy. Here&rsquo;s a few that I have recognized.</p>

<p><strong>The oak tree.</strong> This company is rock solid and has been that way for many years. After establishing itself initially, stable but modest growth has lead to a consistency over time. To be successful at this company, you must deeply agree with the culture and value system. This can be a great place to have a long tenure and create long term professional relationship. Rebels and change agents need not apply.</p>

<p><strong>The Butterfly.</strong> This company is always morphing into something new. Things that are important today may have less valuable in the future. Hot and cold streaks plague the company&rsquo;s history. Take a job here only if you think that the experience you will gain out weighs the risk of a left turn when you least expect it. Often very few people know when the left turn is coming.</p>

<p><strong>The junkyard dog.</strong> This company will do anything to keep busy and stay in business. Web site? Mobile? ASP.NET? LAMP? Yep they do that. Take a job here if you want to be a jack of all trades. These are usually good resume builders and companies where you can figure out what technologies you are most passionate about. The downside can be randomization and lack of direction, usually the technology leadership is not necessarily that deeply technical because it is very difficult to be deep in all technologies.</p>

<p><strong>The Corporation.</strong> They are Enterprise. They are monumental. They will put a complex plan into place and deliver solid results on time and on budget through deliberate and consistent execution. You&rsquo;ll excel here if you enjoy structure and thrive when things are planned out to microscopic detail. Here&rsquo;s to &ldquo;synergy&rdquo;!</p>

    <p><a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a> launched in the U.S. on July 14th. Given the hoopla around the service I decided to give it a try. Spotify is a music service that allows users to stream or download music, includes social integration and has support for offline listening. Many people have raved about the service in Europe and there has been a constant chorus for an american launch.</p>

<p>After 5 days of use, here&rsquo;s my impressions:</p>

<p>Great value. You get all the music you can handle, offline downloading (including offline for iPhone) for just $10 a month. That is fantastic. I have found that most if not all of the music I care about is available. Spotify has deals with all the major labels, so there is a good chance that it will always have the latest music. There is also a $5 per month option when doesn&rsquo;t allow offline listening and a free ad supported version.</p>

<p>Version 1 application. The Spotify application for windows is good, fast and stable. It is lacking features though. There is no drill down-down by artist or album. Come on, that is obvious and available in all competing products.</p>

<p>I would say the social integration is fairly simple as well. You can see all your Facebook friends who have a Spotify account and view their shared playlists. This seems like the simplest possible social implementation.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that Spotify needs to catch up to Zune and iTunes in terms of features for desktop.</p>

<p>Fast! I have found that playback is extremely fast and reliable. Streaming is particularly good, you mostly can&rsquo;t tell that a song is streaming at all. Playback of streaming is almost as good as local playback. Skipping and scrubbing are instantaneous, searches are</p>

<p>Many people, including Sean Parker (who is a Spotify investor) say that Spotify is the anwser to music piracy. I think that Spotify has a lot of potential and will be very popular in the short term but it remains to be seen who will win the cloud music wars.</p>

    <p>My marathon journey started in the summer of 2009. I got pneumonia and spent 3 days in the hospital. After recovering, I knew that I needed to get fit and running seemed like a good idea. I started to run regularly, not really thinking that I would get involved in long distance competitive running.</p>

<p>A few months later, I was running 20+ miles a week. I began to think that I may want to do some races in the area, just for fun. I tried a 5K and a 10K. I quickly realized that competitive racing is very different from training. I was surprised at the energy that I had on race day. Lining up with a few hundred people is a exhilarating experience. It gave me a boost that I was not expecting.</p>

<p>In 2010, I ran 2 half marathons. These were a bit of a challenge but I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge and the feeling of accomplishment. By this time, it became clear to me that I was capable of running a full marathon. Why not give it a try?</p>

<p>I choose to run the <a href="http://runrocknroll.competitor.com/seattle">Seattle Rock n Roll Marathon</a>. The rock n roll marathon has grown to be the largest organized series of competitive running races in the United States. The Seattle event was close to home and I had run the half-marathon there in 2010.</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Non-Runners-Marathon-Trainer-David-Whitsett/dp/1570281823/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1318267602&amp;sr=1-1">The Non-Runner&rsquo;s Marathon Trainer</a> as a guide. This is a 16 week program which is based on a college course taught with the purpose of turning anyone into a marathoner. I highly recommend the book. It has a solid training schedule and many stories of people from all walks of like that eventually completed a marathon.</p>

<p>I followed the program (mostly). I did skip some of the shorter distance running toward the later part of the program, but I did all the long runs. After the program works its way toward an 18 mile run on week 14, it tapers off to race day.</p>

<p>The training was difficult. From a timing perspective fitting a 3 hour run into my schedule was not easy. Plus there is the recover time, which can be considerable. I could not have pulled this off without support for the wife and family.</p>

<p>As I built up to longer distances, I realized a few things. First and foremost, your body is capable of much more than your mind will allow. One of the most important things is to believe in yourself and use the power of positive thinking. Once negative thoughts creep into your head, you are finished. Giving up is the easiest thing to do. Stay positive and don&rsquo;t allow your mind to dwell on physical pain or</p>

<p>I found that on long runs, it is most important to set a solid pace and  short term goals. Running 18 miles can be daunting, especially when you are on mile 3. I generally try to break the run into 3 mile segments and set a time goal for each. Early to middle distances (1 to 10 miles), I try to run each 3 mile segment in 30 minutes each. This gives me a target pace of 10 minutes per mile. I try to block all thoughts outside of meeting these short term goals.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Non-Runners-Marathon-Trainer-David-Whitsett/dp/1570281823/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1318267602&amp;sr=1-1">the book</a>, is to have some positive phrases that you repeat to yourself when the going gets tough. My favorite is to say to yourself &ldquo;Hello ______, come run with me.&rsquo; As in &ldquo;Hello knee pain, come run with me.&rdquo; This works beautifully when you are deflated and thinking of giving up on a run. It implies that you will overcome any and all obstacles on the way to completing your goal.</p>

<p>There could be 1,000 reasons to stop but it&rsquo;s up to you to stay the course and complete the run by not accepting failure. This has helped me tremendously in life. If I can fight through these challenges, then nothing can stand in my way.</p>

<p>For training, I ran mostly on the hills of Snoqualmie Ridge, in the cascade foothills of Washington. The training was brutal, although running in the hills would pay off in the end.</p>

<p>Then came race day. I felt prepared, I was ready. Still there was some doubt, the longest training run in 18 miles and the race in 26 miles. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Non-Runners-Marathon-Trainer-David-Whitsett/dp/1570281823/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1318267602&amp;sr=1-1">The book</a> claims a 99.9% success rate for people who follow the training, but there was still a lingering doubt at the back of my logical mind. I pushed that aside and the race started.</p>

<p>I was one of 26,000 people starting the race in Tukwilla, WA. What a scene at the starting line!</p>

<div class="vinette">
    <img src="/images/Start-5-640x575.jpg" />
    the start
</div>

<p>For the first 13 miles, I stayed on pace and only stopped to drink. I passed the half way point (13.1 miles) in 2 hours, 6 minutes. My best half-marathon is 1 hour, 54 minutes. Needless to say, I was pleased. :)</p>

<p>Feeling good, I tackled the last half of the course. The going got tough around mile 15, with a steep climb. I started to alternate between walking and running, trying to run at least half a mile, then walking a quarter of a mile.</p>

<p>Luckily at mile 18 the course doubles back for a smooth 2 mile downhill run. I focused on hydration, drinking 8 ounces of water or sport drink every 30 minutes. Around mile 19, my stomach became upset and it was hard to drink anything but water.</p>

<p>After mile 20, I was tested severely. At this point, there was a general sense among all runners that we were in for a serious test from here on out. I saw many people pulling out with cramps or sitting/laying down from pure exhaustion. I soldiered through, using my walk/run strategy.</p>

<p>The cruelest part of the race came at mile 22. Here the course weaves close enough to the finish line that I could see people finishing the race at around 3 hours and 45 minutes. My first thought was, &ldquo;YES!&rdquo; it&rsquo;s almost over. My mind was not functioning clearly, we had 5 miles to go.</p>

<p>Soon, I crested a hill and was able to see the last turnaround, almost 2 miles down the road. My heart sunk. I was not sure if my legs could travel that far after such a long day. I recovered about 10 minutes later.</p>

<p>I realized that I could finish the race in under 5 hours if I ran those 5 miles is under 1 hour. It was a slog. I cramped just above the knee in both legs. I was running as far as I could before cramping and getting only about 2 tenths of a mile at a time. I kept plugging away and finally I turned for home.</p>

<p>Just before the finish line, I saw my wife, my 2 kids and my parents cheering me on. It was the best thing I had seen all day.</p>

<p>After a quick picture and hugs, I headed for the finish line. What a great feeling. I didn&rsquo;t expect to get emotional but it hit me when I saw the finish line. I had done it! My first marathon. What an experience.</p>

    <p>Open data protocol or OData is a new Microsoft technology standard which allows for simple data exchange over a REST style interface. The idea is to create a web based interface for complex data stores and in the process free data from silos. This will in theory create a data utopia complete with bunnies, fairies and a side of mash potatoes.</p>

<p>There are a couple of intriguing facets to this proposition. First, since OData is purely REST based, data is available cross platform and also on the client side. JavaScript is a real possibility as a data consumer, mashups just got a whole lot better. To top it all off, natively you can get data in Atom or JSON formats, making JavaScript a first class consumer.</p>

<p>Secondly, Microsoft has bundled a LINQ provider with the .Net Framework. This makes server side integration a snap. You can literal point to an OData endpoint and start writing a LINQ query against it. Bring on the fairies.</p>

<p>To start out, download LINQPad. LINQPad is a lightweight tool that let&rsquo;s you query a LINQ data source in real-time with minimal setup necessary. It gives you a great interface to run quick LINQ based queries. LINQPad does not require an OData source in fact you can use LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework endpoints among others.</p>

<p>Once you have installed LINQPad, click on new connection. For the data context user &ldquo;WCF Data Service (OData)&rdquo;. For the URI use <a href="http://odata.netflix.com/catalog">http://odata.netflix.com/catalog</a>. That&rsquo;s right the Netflix catalog has an OData interface!</p>

<p>OData sources are broken into top level elements called collections. You can think of collections as two dimensional tables with columns and rows. A column can also represent a relationship between two collections.</p>

<p>You can see that in our Netflix service endpoint there are several collections that define the dimensions tracked within the catalog. Genres, People, Titles, etc. This is where the cool starts. You can now construct LINQ queries against the Netflix catalog by typing some LINQ syntax into the main windows and hitting F5.</p>

<p><img src="/images/image_thumb5.png" alt="" />
</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with LINQ syntax, here are tons of examples:
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336746">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336746</a></p>

<p>To use OData from Visual Studio, open a new project, add a new service reference and paste in the Netflix service endpoint URI. VS will automatically understand that this is an OData service and that it should generate a LINQ context class and all the associated classes that define the data collections and data types. Fairies!</p>

<p>Now you can code against this new LINQ data source as you would any other. However, watch out for performance. Remember that you have taken an outside dependency into your project, anytime you do this there are inherent risks.</p>

<p>Furthermore, LINQ makes the query process very transparent which means that you can flagrantly throw queries at you data source without regard for impact to the service. Bottom line is, think about what you are doing.  Do I really need to run this extra query? Can I consolidate this data pull into a single query?</p>

    <p>Estimating a project can be one of the hardest things you do as a technology consultant. Over the years I have done my share of estimation and one thing has become clear to me. Estimation accurately is almost impossible. With lots of experience and some hard knocks, you can accumulate the courage necessary to throw down an estimate. Here&rsquo;s a few tips that I think might help.</p>

<p>Ask a lot of questions. The first thing you need to do is ask a ton of questions. The only way to get to the bone of the implementation is to understand all the information currently available about the project. Ask the WWWWH (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) questions.</p>

<p>When you think you have exhausted all the questions in your head, take a walk and forget about the estimation exercise. When you come back you will have more questions, no doubt.</p>

<p>There may very well be details that haven&rsquo;t been discovered. As the estimator, it is your job to put down a valid estimate. This isn&rsquo;t the motivation of the sales person, your business lead or the client for that matter. Having a valid estimate creates a framework and a roadmap that the team will follow throughout the project. Without solid questions you are shooting in the dark.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Be detailed. It&rsquo;s impossible to estimate any complex project by taking a high level view and throwing out numbers. You need to break the project down into digestible pieces in order to make sensible estimates that can hold water. For a budgetary estimate, I like to have my work broken down to no larger then 8 hour chunks. Based on this rule it is difficult to miss something entirely or overestimate something by more than 8 hours :)</p>

<p>Most times, the deeper that you think about the work, the more you realize that there are intricacies that you may not have considered when thinking at a high level. You need to find the bottom of the rabbit hole.</p></li>

<li><p>Assume away risk. One of the most important tools you have as an estimator is the assumption. The assumption is beautiful. It is the way that you politely tell a client no. Assumptions are effectively boundaries that define the border of the project scope. You can say what you will do all day, but that doesn&rsquo;t tell anyone what you won&rsquo;t do. Basically there is no good way to make the language around you requirements strong enough to stop a nefarious client from take you for a ride. Assumptions allow you to draw a clear line where the requirement stops.</p></li>

<li><p>Understand your client. You need to understand the client&rsquo;s goals, motivation, risk and reward. This is the context that will make you successful in the estimate process and during the delivery phase. Is the client vague? Are they distracted? Are then detail oriented? Anything that will effect the delivery team should be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>To a varied degree this can give you a &ldquo;gut feel&rdquo; for how the project will be run and communicated. If there are red flags, then you need to call those out, make assumptions and eliminate the perceived risk.</p></li>

<li><p>Build an estimate capable of satisfaction. The idea here is to produce an estimate that will make a client happy. Things change over the course of a project - new requirements, shifting priorities, unknown hurdles. When these changes happen, it is important that your estimate is big enough that you can still make the client happy at the end of the day.</p></li>

<li><p>You are probably thinking, &ldquo;well, why don&rsquo;t I just make the estimate huge?&rdquo;. The trick is to make the estimate big enough to accommodate the unknown but also fit into a logical and economical budget number. If you strike this balance it will allow the project team to manage the project to a happy conclusion because your estimates were large enough to make the client happy. Too small an estimate and there is no room for management.</p></li>
</ol>
