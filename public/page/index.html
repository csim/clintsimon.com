<p>Hi, I am Clint. I&rsquo;m a technology enthusiast, <a href="http://www.cartoonstock.com/directory/s/software_engineer.asp">software developer</a>, father, husband, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun">cajun</a>, worrywart and sometimes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_the_Grouch">grouch</a>. I live in the suburbs of Seattle where I watch <a href="http://www.lsusports.net/">LSU football</a> and enjoy our annual crawfish boil. I have 2 daughters which leaves me as the only man in the house. Even the dog is female.</p>

<h2 id="work:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">work</h2>

<p>I have worked in the technology consulting industry for roughly 15 years as a software engineer and architect. Much of my career has be devoted to Microsoft, building business applications that help to keep the wheels turning in Redmond.</p>

<p>I started out in the early days of the World Wide Web (remember that?!) when Mosaic and Gopher were all the rage. In college I discovered that I could write PERL scripts on my school account and have those run over the web. I was hooked! I quickly became addicted and that started the career that I have today. I got a web development job during college and that later turned into a software consulting career.</p>

<p>I worked for many years as a generalist doing Classic ASP, ColdFusion, ASP.net and SQL server. I later focused on platforms, spending a few years doing custom application development with SharePoint and most recently working with Dynamics CRM.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I&rsquo;ve built a bunch of <a href="#projects">side projects</a>. Most are toys that I have used to feed my coding addiction. Some are useful and others aren&rsquo;t. I had fun building all of them.</p>

<p>If you are interested in more information about my work, <a href="/resume">take a look at my resume</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/crossfit_afro.jpg" class="pull-right img-responsive img-rounded" style="width: 200px; padding-left: 20px;" /></p>

<p>Outside of work I love guitar, golf, football and being a dad to my 2 daughters. <a href="http://cajunjourneymen.com">Hiking is also a passion</a>. I ran <a href="/2011/07/01/first-marathon-complete">my first marathon</a> on June 26, 2011 in a time of 4 hours and 55 minutes.</p>

<p>My most recent addiction is <a href="http://games.crossfit.com">Crossfit</a>. After about an 18 year hiatus from organized physical activity, I started Crossfit in July of 2011. For the first 3 months I proceeded to try my hardest but constantly felt like a used dish towel. I stuck with it and I have seen huge improvement in my physical fitness level. Although the path is difficult, I would not change a thing.</p>

<p>Rapid Tools for SharePoint 2007 is a set of developer tools that are dedicated to making SharePoint developers more productive. Rapid tools enables developers to build SharePoint custom applications using the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Traditionally using the SDL with the SharePoint platform has been a painful and awkward process, but with Rapid Tools for SharePoint, application developers are now in full control of SharePoint development and deployment in a way that was not possible before.</p>
