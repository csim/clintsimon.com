    <p>Ever since I can remember I have been an addict. Over the years my addictions have come and gone. But one thing has always remained: I have an addictive personality. Luckily for me all my addictions have been mostly productive.</p>

<p>It started when I got my first computer, the Commodore 64. At the age of 10 I got the C64 for Christmas and soon after I learned the BASIC programming language so that I could study my Spanish vocabulary words. I know that sounds strange, and it probably is. I didn&rsquo;t know it yet but I would soon be spending more time coding the Spanish test than learning the Spanish words. It was the first addiction in a long string.</p>

<p>Later in college, I discovered the World Wide Web (remember that?) and my addictive personality struck again. I started to build an application in Perl 3, and before I knew it I was in deep. This time it was much worse. I started to skip class to build the application. Luckily the skills that I formed during that time have served me well but the truth is that I really had no self-control or cognizant influence. Once I started to build that app, the runaway train had left the station.</p>

<p>There was a burning in my gut that I could not quench. The cycle of changing the script and seeing the results was like a drug. Over and over and over I would pound at the keyboard and wait for the results like a junkie waits for the next hit. It was hypnotic and I was absolutely hooked.</p>

<p>Programming has taught me so much throughout my life. Persistent, dedication, thoughtfulness, selflessness. And it all started with that Perl script which I stumbled into. There is still something so pure about making the computer do exactly what you want it to do. <em>Today this fire is still burning within me.</em></p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not the end of the story. After my career became stable, I found other outlets. First it was gaming. StarCraft, Quake/Quakeworld and later World of Warcraft. It was the same, I couldn&rsquo;t get enough. There was always more to accomplish, mountains to climb and opponents to vanquish.</p>

<p>And that brings us to my latest addiction. <a href="http://www.crossfit.com">Crossfit</a>. All I want to do is exercise, which is strange. After being an athlete in high school I seldom had any meaningful physical activity (outside of hiking) for over 15 years. It&rsquo;s the damnedest thing, all I want to do now is work my butt off in the gym. The addiction gene has struck again. And again the results have been positive.</p>

<p>Well killing me is a little extreme. I often wonder how these good addictions come to me. Did I seek them out or have I just been lucky?</p>
